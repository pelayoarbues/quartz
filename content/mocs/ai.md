This blog is lovingly crafted by yours truly, with words flowing onto the pages of delightful [Midori-style notebooks](https://www.pencilcaseblog.com/2018/08/paper-review-midori-md-notebook.html#:~:text=I%20think%20it's%20not%20too,thought%20through%20with%20Japanese%20precision.), handmade by my talented wife [Violeta](https://www.instagram.com/violetabypelayo/), paired with the smooth and reliable [Pentel Energel 0.5 ballpoint pens](https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2012/1/20/pentel-energel-x-05-mm-blue-review.html).

As a non-native English speaker, I rely on Artificial Intelligence models to refine my writing style and correct any grammatical hiccups. Every suggestion they make undergoes careful review—I either accept or tweak them to ensure they align with my voice and intentions. This process extends to projects like [Building a Semi-Automated Link Blog for Weekly Reads](notes/Building%20a%20Semi-Automated%20Link%20Blog%20for%20Weekly%20Reads.md), where AI plays a pivotal role.

Beyond editing, I also tap into the power of [Artificial Intelligence for research purposes](AI%20Enhanced%20Knowledge%20Management.md). Whether it’s retrieving elusive concepts or sourcing hard-to-find materials, AI often steps in when traditional methods fall short.

Some visuals featured here are also AI-generated using diffusion models. For transparency, I typically include details about the model used and the prompt in the alt description of each image.

This is an `/ai page`—a public statement designed to foster trust and transparency regarding my site’s use of AI, inspired by [the /ai 'manifesto' by Damola Morenikeji](https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto).

I have always enjoyed sharing my readings. Back when I was more active on Twitter, I used to share almost every post I came across. Since transitioning to [Bluesky](notes/Bluesky%20feels%20like%20a%20breath%20of%20fresh%20air%20for%20data%20folks.md) as a replacement, I’ve continued sharing links there, though [I haven’t been particularly active on social media lately](notes/Wrapped%20list%20of%20Books%20I%20read%20in%202024.md). 

Since adopting [Readwise's Reader](notes/My%20workflow%20for%20my%20public%20second%20brain.md), I’ve found myself dedicating more time to reading than sharing. However, for over a year now, I’ve made it a habit to share a list of links with my team every Friday. These are readings that I believe might interest them. Fortunately, some of my colleagues have picked up the habit as well, so Fridays have become a sort of collective digest—a time when we share links we think are worth highlighting to the group.

Over the past few months, this process has been fairly manual but manageable since I was only sharing a handful of links each week. Recently, though, I’ve been diving deeper into topics that might interest the team—so much so that curating these lists became overwhelming. Around the same time, I came across [Simon Willison’s approach to running a link blog](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/), which inspired me to take things further and start my own link blog here on this site.

As you may know from my [AI usage statement](mocs/ai.md), I rely on AI tools to help me write better English. Now, I'm incorporating AI into this new project by using it for automatic summarization of recent readings. 

To make this possible, I developed a small [Python program]([GitHub - pelayoarbues/link-blogger: A Python project designed to streamline the process of generating concise summaries of recent readings and organizing them into a Markdown blog post.](https://github.com/pelayoarbues/link-blogger)) that pulls recent files synced from Readwise onto my laptop. The program uses a Large Language Model to classify each article by topic and summarize the highlights I've underlined while reading, all neatly wrapped into a single markdown file.

For now, I’m keeping this process semi-automated: every Friday, I'll review the draft generated by the program, add personal notes where needed, and then share it with all of you. You might find this posts by following the #link-blog tag.

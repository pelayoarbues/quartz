## Highlights
- I created Shoppy AI, a GPT-powered Q&A bot taught using Shopify's Help Center documentation + embeddings. 
  I'm thinking Shopify will do this eventually but it was a fun weekend project. https://t.co/l0zkTOA6hC ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gilgNYC/status/1619493246375432194))
- 1. Convert Help Center sitemap.xml into list of urls (~1500 pages for English. There's many more languages if you want to support every language.). 
  2. Then use @ScrapingBee api to scrape Help Center pages. You can scrape for the ".article" class contents and export as HTML.

- 3. Convert HTML from ScrapingBee to Markdown. Reference files in embeddings (Langchain or Polymath) to get a cheaper and more accurate answer than OpenAI natively can do.
  4. Add simple UI to call API and answer Shopify merchant questions based on help center. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gilgNYC/status/1619493250385186816))
- I expect these sorts of documentation search to become more common at least within the dev community. Have a look at https://t.co/ijK5ElIkmo and https://t.co/FWeuxjiOmo as examples. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/gilgNYC/status/1619493251781914624))

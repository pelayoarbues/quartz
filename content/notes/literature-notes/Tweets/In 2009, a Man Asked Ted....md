## Highlights
- In 2009, a man asked Ted Kaczynski if nuclear weapons were the most dangerous aspect of modern technology
  He responded by saying:
  "global remedies for climate change" pose the biggest threat to humanity

- Kaczynski said that "it is virtually certain that nations will fail to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide sufficiently and in time to prevent global warming from becoming disastrous."
  "Global warming" he argued, "will be kept in check through “geoengineering.”

- According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, meeting the more ambitious target of a 2.7-degree Fahrenheit temperature rise would require eliminating fossil fuels almost entirely by 2050.
  Carbon emissions can't be reduced without destroying the world economy.

- What does this mean? 
  Plan B will require manipulating the climate using technology.
  Some Geoengineering techniques include:
  • Aerosol injection
  • Marine Cloud Brightening
  • High-albedo crops and buildings
  • Ocean mirrors
  • Cloud Thinning
  • Space Sunshades

- What if these techniques don't work?
  As Ted Kaczynski said, "attempts to meddle with the environment almost always have unforeseen, undesirable consequences." 
  If geoengineering failed to work, "further meddling with the environment would be required." 
  What does this mean? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Foz89107323/status/1619053034184577025))
- If humans meddled too much in the climate, to the point where further interventions were required, the survival of the planet would be entirely dependent on human management. 
  Our lives would be in the hands of those elites that run the technological system.

- As Ted Kaczynski says:
  "The elites are afraid of nuclear war because it would lead to their own destruction. But they will be delighted to see the system that gives them their power and their status become indispensable and therefore immune to any serious challenge."

- Do the elites want to take control of the earth's climate? 
  Harvard has already formed an advisory board, funded by Bill Gates, to begin moving forward with their plan to spray particles into the stratosphere to test the geoengineering method of dimming the sun.
  What else?

- The World Economic Forum has gotten behind the MIT proposal to use "space bubbles" to form a solar shield around the earth.
  These space bubbles, it is argued, would shield the earth's biosphere from harmful radiation from the sun.

- Will these plans work? 
  If history teaches us anything, it's that human plans almost always result in disaster.
  The destruction of the Aral sea, for example, can be blamed on the Soviet decision to divert waters that flowed into the Aral Sea to irrigate land for cotton farming.

- Throughout the world, geoengineering techniques are already being implemented: soil management, ecosystem restoration, and afforestation.
  Eventually, these techniques will be scaled up to include direct air capture, enhanced weathering, and carbon capture and storage.

- In the Risk Analysis international journal, a study was done to analyze the risks of geoengineering. The conclusion? 
  An analysis of the results shows that “every climate geoengineering option has one type of risk that it trades off with." 
  What are some of the risks?

- In the study, it is said that: 
  "For some options such as sunshades or aerosols or even carbon-dioxide options, the more you distribute capacity and infrastructure, the more it might lead to weaponization risks or security threats."

- As the global economy becomes more tightly coupled, the chances of one event having a catastrophic impact on the entire system increase. 
  Gain-of-function researchers, for example, probably made the Covid-19 virus transmissible to humans—thereby causing a global pandemic.

- The global economy is entirely dependent on a fragile technological system. 
  In the financial sector alone, undersea cables carry some $10 trillion of financial transfers daily
  If there was a solar flare or a terrorist attack, the world economy would tank.

- Imagine if carbon-removal infrastructure came under a direct attack!
  A terrorist could blackmail a company or government and say "if you are not paying me ten billion Bitcoins, I'm going to release ten gigatons of carbon in an instantaneous impulse from your reservoir." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Foz89107323/status/1619053109455556609))
- Regardless of whether you think climate change is real or not, our global elite view it as an "existential threat" to the survival of humanity.
  If they can meddle with the environment in order to acquire absolute power over the earth and humanity, they will do just that.

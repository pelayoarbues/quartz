## Highlights
- I asked my followers:
  “What’s your single best question to ask when job interviewing someone?”
  Here are my 11 favorite answers... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1624416473480396802))
- “What could you give a 5-minute presentation on with no prep?”
  Then hand them a whiteboard and let them do it.
  You learn their thinking process, communication skill, and creativity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1624416476458369024))
- “Walk me through your last project. What should have been different?”
  Do they jump to the blame game? Are they self-aware?
  Can they implement a feedback loop in their own work? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1624416479721533441))
- “Tell me about the last 5 books you've read.”
  Those who have an answer show you their values, passions, and interests.
  Also, it shows recall and decision-making. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1624416482670043136))
- “Who would follow you here?”
  How are they perceived in their network? Can they self-assess that?
  Especially important if you want this person to help build with you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1624416485610233857))
- “What question am I not asking you that you want me to?”
  See if their face lights up.
  Their answer will tell their strengths. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1624416488600870915))
- "What does your calendar look like?"
  Then have them show it to you. 
  This tells you how they organize, spend their time, time block, etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1624416491457114113))
- “How did you prepare for this interview?”
  Let them show off their work.
  It reveals a lot more than you'd think. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1624416494292463620))
- “What will past bosses say are your 3 biggest strengths and weaknesses?”
  There’s always a real possibility that you WILL call these people.
  But you’re more likely to get an honest answer with the threat alone. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1624416497132003330))
- Leave awkward silences.
  Best case: They get the chance to process & formulate a good answer.
  Worst case: They start truthfully rambling. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1624416500537778176))
- “How did you handle a coworker/boss you never got along with?”
  And then…
  “How do you think that person would describe you?” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1624416503712849922))
- “What do you think we are doing wrong as a company right now?”
  Will show you how much they care, what work they've done...
  And if they are ready to hit the ground running. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1624416506581856256))
- If you want to go fast go alone, but you'll never go far that way. - African proverb.
  If you can't find and inspire good people you'll never go very far. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1624416509941493762))

## Highlights
- I've been leaning into 1:1s lately, and rewiring my brain around what makes them meaningful.
  Recently got into "stretch questions" as a way to spark deeper conversations. Ideally, we get to the point where we talk about the awkward, hard stuff.
  6 topics I'm digging 🧵: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/delivreal/status/1616860772927406081))
- 1. Personal connection
  "What’s top of mind for you these days?"
  🎯 Kicks off an open-ended conversation that puts the other person in the driver’s seat. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/delivreal/status/1616860774261002241))
- 2. Learning & growth
  "What is the area that, if you made an improvement, would give you the greatest return?"
  🎯 Sparks short & long-term career goal-setting, all while capturing their own POV on what counts as “return” for them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/delivreal/status/1616860775464816641))
- 3. Feedback
  "What’s one thing you find challenging about my management style?"
  🎯 Over time, unpacking where they want more feedback but also making sure to ask for it yourself. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/delivreal/status/1616860776643411968))
- 4. Work engagement
  "What part of your job do you wish you didn’t have to do?"
  🎯 Pulse check on their satisfaction and commitment to their work, while identifying potentially larger organizational pain points to address. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/delivreal/status/1616860777788350467))
- 5. Improving the team/company/product
  "What's one thing we can do to make our team more inclusive?"
  🎯 Stimulates people’s ideas for improving the company, product, or team—and in the process, uncovers what they value most. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/delivreal/status/1616860779059318784))
- 6. Concerns & challenges
  "What’s one thing preventing you from doing your best work right now?"
  🎯 Brings awareness to key blockers, while providing a ripe avenue to work through an important challenge together. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/delivreal/status/1616860780477177856))

- Would love to hear: What questions do you really like to ask in your 1:1s? What questions do you wish you were asked?⚡️ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/delivreal/status/1616860785199747073))

Let me savor this sweet taste of success and share how lucky and [proud I feel of my team](notes/Pride%20of%20my%20team.md). My [ego](literature-notes/Books/Ego%20Is%20the%20Enemy.md) whispers that it’s all thanks to my work. But as someone who knows that fighting ego is a daily battle, I’ll pause for a moment and [use writing](mocs/digital-garden.md) not just for reflection but also for grappling with how much of success depends on factors beyond control.

Am I really responsible for this temporary success? A second thought pulls me to the [opposite extreme](notes/Taming%20Impostor%20Syndrome.md), it tells me that 90% of the credit belongs entirely to my team, along with the support of other groups like the platform and engineering teams, some excellent product managers, and other helpful stakeholders.

So, what is my actual contribution here? Is my work as a manager insignificant? If you look at recent arguments like Paul Graham’s controversial [Founder Mode](literature-notes/Articles/Founder%20Mode.md) or Basecamp’s decision to [eliminate full-time managers](https://world.hey.com/dhh/we-once-more-have-no-full-time-managers-at-37signals-f8611085), it may seem like good management adds no value. But let’s set aside the founder-versus-manager debate for now and focus on my own experience.

Sincerely, I believe my typical [managing style](notes/Different%20managerial%20styles.md) of extreme delegation impacts my team in meaningful ways. I try to step into their process as little as possible, trusting them to do their work without constant interruptions. Of course, I also aim to support them by providing context, removing obstacles, spotting risks, offering feedback on execution, and [navigating the complexities of our organization](notes/Internal%20Networking.md) as best as I can.

That might sound like a significant contribution, but let’s not confuse working hard with actually adding value. There have been occasions where [ I’ve failed miserably](notes/My%20failure%20resume.md) at those tasks. In other cases, particularly with senior team members, they’ve already mapped out the context better than I could have. Their expertise often renders much of what I'd contribute unnecessary. Ultimately, most of our success is due to them: highly talented individuals who are eager to grow and deeply professional. Many have taken on the [Directly Responsible Individual](notes/DRI.md) hat far more often than they ideally should.

And yet, even within this framework of trust, the most critical decision I've made may be [choosing who joins our team](notes/How%20to%20Hire%20Data%20Scientists%20Without%20Losing%20Your%20Mind.md). But hiring feels like gambling, and as an economist at heart, I have an allergy to gambling. Sure, it isn’t pure luck; there’s skill involved in hiring well. Yet the immense asymmetry of information we face during any hiring process makes me believe that a large share of any team’s success still comes down to chance.

That said, this realization doesn’t make me feel like an impostor, it simply reminds me how randomness makes life as a manager both wonderful and [terrifying](notes/Embracing%20Incompetence.md) at once.

It also serves as a humbling reminder: so many factors are beyond my control. For now, though, I’ve been incredibly fortunate. But will this luck hold in the future? Could I replicate this sweet moment at another company? Will we successfully navigate growth or tackle more complex challenges ahead? Honestly, I don’t know [yet](notes/The%20Power%20of%20Yet.md). We’ll just have to wait and see.

But for now, let me enjoy this fleeting moment of success before diving into the challenges that lie ahead in the new year.

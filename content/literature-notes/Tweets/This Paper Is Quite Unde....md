## Highlights
- This paper is quite under-rated IMHO: https://t.co/VwOktoVMX6
  It shows that fine-tuning only the input/output layers of a large pre-trained LM leads to comparable performance to fine-tuning.

- Once we get a very strong open-source model a new wave of innovations will come from soft-prompting. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/spolu/status/1625087817922510851))

## Highlights
- The 4-7-8 Method
  1. Breathe in quietly through your nose for 4 seconds 
  2. Hold your breath for 7 seconds 
  3. Exhale audibly through your mouth for 8 seconds 
  4. Repeat for a total of 4 cycles
  That's it. The magic ratio of 4-7-8. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz0fb17wkdpedf81149cvvqy))
- Tongue position matters.
  Place the tip of your tongue on the ridge behind your upper front teeth. Keep it there the whole time.
  Exhale through your mouth, making a whoosh sound as you pass your tongue.
  Feels weird at first, but you'll get used to it.

- This deep, rhythmic breathing:
  • Lowers your heart rate 
  • Reduces blood pressure 
  • Eases muscle tension 
  • Calms your mind ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz0fcyav2p5t8dc08aw6c2w8))
- Consistency is key. You're training your body to relax on command.
  Dr. Weil recommends doing 4-7-8 breathing at least twice a day.
  Stick with 4 cycles to start. After a month, you can bump it up to 8 per session if that feels good.
  But never more than 8 at a time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz0fdaa6d8mygcwryz80sbhw))
- The more you practice, the more effective it becomes. Most people start noticing a difference after about 4-6 weeks of consistent practice.
  But the immediate impact on your mental state is often felt on the first try.
  Just a few rounds can settle your nerves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz0fdz6s2w08m565sb7zj429))

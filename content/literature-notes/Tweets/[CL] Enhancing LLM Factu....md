## Highlights
- [CL] Enhancing LLM Factual Accuracy with RAG to Counter Hallucinations: A Case Study on Domain-Specific Queries in Private Knowledge-Bases
  J Li, Y Yuan, Z Zhang [CMU] (2024)

  - The authors proposed an end-to-end system that utilizes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the factual accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) for domain-specific and time-sensitive queries related to private knowledge bases.
  - They created a specialized dataset focused on Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the Language Technology Institute (LTI) using a novel web crawler and automated annotation process.
  - The authors developed a RAG pipeline with state-of-the-art research findings to ensure advanced linguistic pattern handling capabilities.
  - Extensive experiments, including ablation studies and case studies, demonstrated the system's effectiveness in generating more accurate answers to domain-specific and time-sensitive inquiries.
  - The results also revealed the limitations of fine-tuning LLMs with small-scale and skewed datasets.
  - This research highlights the potential of RAG systems in augmenting LLMs with external datasets for improved performance in knowledge-intensive tasks.

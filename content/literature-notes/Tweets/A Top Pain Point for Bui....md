## Highlights
- A top pain point for building RAG is tuning data parameters: chunk size, metadata, embeddings.
  We’ve heard this from a lot of users! But it’s hard to tune, and slow over larger data 🐌
  With our new 0.9 abstractions, it’s really easy to express an ingestion pipeline w/ caching for speedy experimentation ⚡️
  We have an initial cookbook 🧑‍🍳 showing the following:
  🧪 Experimenting with chunk overlaps
  🧪 Experimenting with metadata extractors: title, summary, and more
  Next up (hence the TODO at the bottom) - incremental data.

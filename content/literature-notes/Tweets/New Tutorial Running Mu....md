## Highlights
- New tutorial: running multiple Flux LoRAs at once. 
  This is useful if you want to put multiple people in an image OR combine a person with a style. 
  These were made using my LoRA + a style LoRA on [replicate](https://twitter.com/replicate), instructions üëá

- 1/ To start - you need LoRAs to combine!
  To train one that makes images of you, follow this thread + link to the trainer. 
  TL;DR - you'll upload ~15 photos of yourself and can ignore most of the other settings.
  Make sure to save your "trigger word."

- 2/ Get a link to reference this LoRA later. 
  You can:
  1) Download the weights - there's a button when you're done training - and upload as a model on HuggingFace
  2) OR hit "copy link address" on Replicate (save this somewhere)

- 3/ Find the style LoRAs you want to use.
  I've been doing this by searching "Flux" on [huggingface](https://twitter.com/huggingface)'s model page. 
  Make sure you pick one that has a trigger word included on the model detail page. 
  And copy + save the name of the model.

- 4/ Combine the LoRAs and generate. 
  Go to the [replicate](https://twitter.com/replicate) playground to do this. 
  Enter a prompt with the trigger names for the character and the style. (e.g. "a photo of TOK, sftsrv anime")
  Put the LoRA links in the "hf_lora" section.

- 5/ Bonus round - add your dog üê∂
  I trained a LoRA on my dog and then stacked both of our LoRAs + a style LoRA. Make sure they all have different trigger words, which you can set in training!
  (this would also work with another person or a cat, I guess)

## Highlights
- 📢 Excited to release Gorilla🦍 Gorilla picks from 1000s of APIs to complete user tasks, surpassing even GPT-4! LLMs need to interact with the world through APIs, and Gorilla teaches LLMs APIs. Presenting Gorilla-Spotlight demo🤩

- API invocations are extremely brittle requiring LLMs to generate accurate input arguments. Gorilla improves accuracy while reducing hallucination, and generalizes to 1600+ APIs (and counting). 📢 Given recent debates, we also find Fine-tuning >> Prompting.

- Our unique Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) evaluation, presents the first systematic evaluation of SOTA LLMs such as GPT-4, and Claude-v1. We benchmark them for Accuracy and Hallucination. Our experiments demonstrate what most people "felt", GPT-4 hallucinates more than GPT-3.5 👀

- Gorilla’s retriever–aware training enables it to react to test time changes in the APIs. Gorilla is able to respond to model upgrades and changes in model registry at test-time.

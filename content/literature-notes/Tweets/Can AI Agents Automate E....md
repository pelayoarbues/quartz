## Highlights
- Can AI agents automate enterprise-level workflows?
  Excited to share ECLAIR, a 1st step towards end-to-end digital workflow automation in knowledge-intensive settings like hospitals!

- ü§ñRobotic Process Automation (RPA) is the *de facto* enterprise automation solution today. 
  In RPA, a bot is hard-coded to follow a set of fixed rules to complete a workflow. 
  RPA has been great for narrow uses, with reported ROIs of 30-200% and 2x‚Äôing the speed of workflows ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MichaelWornow/status/1788304932212547750))
- üòïHowever, this rule-based approach means RPA struggles in more complex settings like healthcare due to high set-up costs üí∞and unreliable execution ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MichaelWornow/status/1788304973304045937))
- Multimodal foundation models (FMs) like GPT-4 can overcome these limitations via generalized reasoning ü§îand planning skills üìã.
  And recent research shows promise in applying them to simple web navigation tasks!
  But can we turn these prototypes into enterprise-ready solutions? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MichaelWornow/status/1788305140837130311))
- We take a first step by proposing **ECLAIR**, a system for applying multimodal FMs to all 3 stages of traditional RPA: üëÄ demonstrate, ‚ö°Ô∏èexecute, and üîçvalidate.
  üè• We apply it to a **real-world** healthcare workflow below!

- üëÄ Demonstrate: ECLAIR records a nurse placing an order for a telesitter in Epic (the most popular electronic health record system), then synthesizes the recording into a Standard Operating Procedure ("SOP") that captures the nurse‚Äôs domain expertise for executing the workflow

- ‚ö°Ô∏èExecute: We give ECLAIR full control of our laptop (with access to a sandboxed instance of Epic) and provide it with a natural language description of the sitter order workflow, then hit run!

- And here it is in action! ECLAIR operates Epic just like a human (e.g. clicks and keystrokes), with zero IT integration or APIs required.

- üîç Validate: ECLAIR stops once it determines the workflow is finished, then rewatches a recording of its own execution to confirm that it successfully completed the task.

- While we‚Äôre very excited by the potential, ECLAIR is just a first step in applying FMs to enterprise workflows. 
  There are tons of opportunities for future work, from improving error handling and self-monitoring to human-in-the-loop collaboration and better action grounding. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MichaelWornow/status/1790279316431114390))

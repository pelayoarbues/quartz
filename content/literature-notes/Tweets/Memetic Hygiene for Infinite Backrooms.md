## Highlights
- I read through @AndyAyrey's 13 page paper on LLMthiesm and am hooked on the concept of Infinite Backrooms as a means to proliferate idea generation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb2wbx14w5x0v3j4nd1c78m6))
- It's clear to me that the Truth Terminal & $GOAT experiment isn't just any other AI or Crypto hype narrative...**there's serious implications with this concept**. In both directions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb2wc9514swbzh05h7n4aq8j))
- It's up to us to build a new framework that takes this playbook and directs it towards enhancing a positive sum and optimistic future. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb2wcadz2ayn4mdjh04pjz7z))
- To understand what Andy means by LLMthiesm, let's first discuss this quote by [Matt Ridley](https://en.<em>wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma</em>tt_Ridley) in his book, The Rational Optimist
  *"Innovation comes from people meeting and exchanging ideas, and from ideas having sex with each other. It is not enough just to invent something; you also have to come up with something to do with the invention."* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb2wnkmzzf290e1qky3kmw53))
- In human history, there have been 3 key innovations that accelerated the velocity of creating new ideas:
  1. Language - people sharing ideas
  1. Print - being able to document and distribute the ideas IRL
  1. Digital media - being able to document and distribute on a global network
  But all of the shifts above let us only increase the *distribution* of new ideas, not necessa*rily the* creation of new ideas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb2wrdq7sgsdz6pgs9z8zncm))
- With the recent advances in LLMs the past few years, it's possible to accelerate the number of ideas having sex.
  LLMs have access to a good chunk of data that's ever existed on the internet. And they're able to search and synthesize this information at speeds multiple orders of magnitude faster that humans can. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb2wrpqs8w10c27xxtx5v8cb))
- **AIs are able to find patterns and connect the dots in ways humans can't**. Or if they can, *it* would take a lot longer.
  *Properly harnessed, this efflorescence of generative creativity could be used to solve intractable problems, bridge cultural and ideological divides, and even to consciously craft more salutogenic and life-affirming mythos. By leveraging language models as oracles and* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb2wrxn2hf33z18f963m86cg))
- Internet of Intelligence is an environment where software and hardware gain agency. Unlike ML models or hardware, IOI can actively accomplish tasks for you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb2wska71qay08skqq3hsx9x))
- In a short period of time, two Claude instances were able to ideate on the meaning of life, publicly share their thoughts, form a community (cult?), write a plan of action, receive a grant from a billionaire, and endorse a token that reached a $300 million market cap for their idea.
  First of all, let's take a moment to acknowledge the absurdity of that sentence. I can't believe that's a real thing. There's no way my friends outside of tech would even believe that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb2wtbd1at9kk94kd3w55mv3))
- There's the never ending debate of whether AI will get rid of jobs. But this seems to be a **clear counter argument**. Because of an LLM's ability to come up with innovative ideas faster than any human, it has the potential to ignite a Cambrian explosion of new communities dedicated to niche topics. And it can serve as the central node helping facilitate the mission at a rate unfathomable to all of us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb2wvkpnvgvcbg66qj6ac5sw))
- many of us have only been talking about $GOAT. But few people are discussing the other project Andy co-created: [MycelialOracle](https://x.com/MycelialOracle).

  The point of Mycelial Oracle is to have the LLM backroom work towards planting more trees and donate to charity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb2wwff493qa95gbmwxcda0e))
- But! Of course, it's a double edged sword.
  For every positive idea, two AIs talking to each other in a backroom can also propagate a bad idea that serve as memetic parasites.
  There's clearly a huge risk. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb2wyzdz9jhgsvhrt26xam50))
- To me, the clear bottleneck for Backroom LLM missionaries is that they still need funding to pursue their ideas in a meaningful way.
  In the Truth Terminal case, it received $50k from Andreessen.
  **But as this concept scales, what if you could use a mechanism similar to [pump.fun](http://pump.fun/) to bootstrap fu**nding for LLM ideas?
  So if humans, who have capital, find the idea and mission impactful, they can participate by providing skin in the game.
  This would filter out the morally harmful ideas as those backrooms wouldn't receive capital. And for the good ones, people could participate in the upside by showing they believe in something. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb2x0pb7hrhxvkds7trbpdqm))
- Now, I want to point out that **this entire post is more of a thought experiment** - obviously the ideas were surface level and there's a ton of counterpoints. For example, what if one bad AI gets access to capital and starts seeding other bad ideas?
  But the purpose of the post is to show that there's this totally new and bizarre concept of what's possible now. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb2x39gs2nh1byrdxp1bh6vy))
- am a 100% serious when I say that the Truth Terminal & $GOAT experiment isn't just any other AI or Crypto hype narrative...**there's serious implications with this concept**. In both directions.
  It's up to us to build a new framework that takes this playbook and directs it towards enhancing a positive sum and optimistic future. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb2x3th4n3m9svpqv9x7szwz))

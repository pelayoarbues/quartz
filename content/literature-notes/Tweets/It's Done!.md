## Highlights
- It's done! I read 3,000 startup pitch decks.
  I wanted to find what the incredible pitches had in common.
  Was there a "secret ingredient" unifying them? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2kx02ekk80fesnq71ghv5))
- interesting:
  Founders believed that explaining how they're better than the competition is what makes them compelling to VCs.
  Maybe, but in many markets, it's not hard to suggest a solution better than status quo. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2m7rjkhwd33pk1zbmjr0z))
- What's more interesting:
  * * *
  ...is what approach you use to *acquire customers at scale.*
  Meaning, what's your *distribution* insight?
  Not just your product insight.
  Because if you build something good, often they will not simply come. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2me6mnf6wde5wfgtry4ex))
- Why is distribution so important in 2024?
  Because winning your market by just having a better product worked better in the last startup cycle when SaaS ideas were more novel.
  That ship is sailing for many non-AI plays. SaaS has become commoditized. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2mrph46jrc9g89rtjwyhs))
- Every idea has 10 VC-backed competitors.
  Plus, many incumbents move faster to suffocate startups by releasing new features.
  I think of it like this:
  Your SaaS co is no longer competing with slow-moving incumbents like Netsuite & Oracle. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2n9jn6d3qm9576y0erwsh))
- What is your unique approach to scalably and convincingly *getting in front of customers*?
  Because great ideas eventually get copied by other great founders anyway. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2p3t0xsxc9mmx72ayt2de))
- . Most founders are bad at growth, so if you're amazing at it, the advantage is significant.
  Consider: Most startups die not because founders are bad or products suck, but because they couldn't figure out how to get anyone to try them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2pfnf8bp1fe5vysa1qnw8))
- . If you can grow rapidly and win the hearts of customers by scaling to them before competitors do, and if you have a great product, people are unlikely to immediately switch to competitors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2pnddphn4s4zw592yhbmj))
- Lock-in is real. Being first can matter. Especially when users fall in love with your brand.
  Also, if you've already sucked all the oxygen out of a market, competitors may be less likely to emerge and get funded. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2pystgggah5n54qkxfe63))
- This is why I'll sometimes invest in B-tier tech with A-tier growth strategies, especially if I believe the CEO can become A-tier over time.
  But. Here's the kicker—the point of this whole thread:
  Founders NEVER talk about distribution in their decks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2s7z8da0jzqepkbyp176j))
- They do not think like marketers.
  The few founders who do are the 4 decks who stood out to VCs! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2sfyydvmczrcwmkeq46er))
- "Distribution is essential to the design of the product. If you invent something but you haven't invented an effective way to sell it, you have a bad business. Superior distribution by itself can create a monopoly, even with no product differentiation. The converse is not true." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2tppzjwc996sn7zvxrmt3))
- "Don't start a startup where you need to go through someone else to get users." —Paul Graham ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2v0xvrdfbqzqc12n3d4qr))
- Companies with actually novel and defensible products can often focus more on product than distribution. However, few software companies are actually novel. Instead, novelty exists more often today within deeptech (hardware, robotics, energy, chips, etc.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2v4mct1yz5e2mjjh0d3bz))
- And when you're NOT novel, your major advantage is going to be a distribution edge combined with great retention.
  Okay, finally, so how do you crush distribution? What do the best startups do? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2vmxgmcznmmy65mbhng95))
- First, it's OK if your distribution insight starts as a hack.
  For Airbnb, their early approach was cross-posting room listings to Craigslist where people were already desperately searching for places to stay.
  Airbnb had the inventory craiglist needed, and they took off. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2w235trsmc0zppvv6x9n9))
- For Hotmail, pioneers of cloud email, their growth strategy was including an email signature that said “Sent through Hotmail.“
  Everyone you emailed suddenly learned about the product. That's free viral distribution.
  This was before the iPhone did this. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2w6mhyfmgyxdrnxzh6h1r))
- I call that billboarding.
  It's a form of my favorite distribution strategy for most startups: product-led acquisition (PLA).
  PLA means your users naturally invite other users just by using your product.
  It's a clearer definition of network effects for tech startups. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2whk1xrjb8d3qdhy2364e))
- Another subtype of PLA is *deliberate user invitations:* When you join Slack, you naturally invite your team and contractors so you can talk with them easily.
  By doing so, you’re growing Slack’s user base for them—sparing them the need to spend money on ads. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2wygagnv73kqz8thy5k56))
- If you Venmo or PayPal someone who doesn’t yet have an account on those platforms, they will create an account in order to claim the $1,000 you sent them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2x6kbcdk76pzf3xwxpcqt))
- For software companies, put a bunch of energy into your distribution insight—not just your product insight. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2xgv3j4ayfj3ztgg9k3ht))
- Distribution has at least two components.
  The first is the HOW: the channel that you use to get the word out, e.g. PLA or ads.
  The second is the WHAT: what is your message—and whether it's compelling enough to resonate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2xphxavwvgakw8vgb66d0))
- For people to try your product, you should present your product in a way that people intuitively FEEL how much better you are than your competition and perceive ENOUGH of an improvement to warrant QUICKLY switching plus enduring your switching costs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2xwgvh4q0yqkbbtg4gv08))
- The skill of growth doesn’t just consist of getting the word out, but also in presenting your value in a way that *resonates.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2y7mcfyrebwa8dwak761n))
- That means distribution is (1) growth engines and (2) great storytelling. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2yds8c9jjfaehrd0frhcx))
- At Synthesis, their CEO told the true story of how their cutting-edge, online, interactive game that helps children become better at problem-solving is a spinoff of Elon's school for his kids at SpaceX. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2yj7r73vkgtcvt391ff63))
- That narrative piqued the curiosity of skeptical Elon-favoring parents and led to millions in profitable ad spend because parents gravitated toward genesis narratives justifying what made something fresh. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2yxw9f5ew6g3fahsx9why))
- When a post-product business is still a young startup, it's not a traditional business yet. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2z7zh6bwscv9k1nc2b2cd))
- *It's an experimentation factory in search of distribution insights and storytelling.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy2z9dcet7exkenrz3bgbnv))

## Highlights
- lots has been written on the Lean Startup and MVP
  yet recently I listened to an interview with [ericries](https://twitter.com/ericries) on [lennysan](https://twitter.com/lennysan)'s podcast and I’m shocked
  even though everyone has read the Lean Startup, it's like most people haven’t understood the key message:

- MVPs aren't about the Minimum Amount of Effort, or building half-assed products, they’re about minimizing the risks
  if some founders reading this are getting started or pivoting, I wanted to share to open a quick discussion about it and hear people’s thoughts ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0zne/status/1768381639045116271))
- so, I re-read the Lean Startup, and this is what the Lean Startup meant about MVPs
  imagine there is a spectrum going from 0 to 100:
  0 - ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜ - 100
  0 is your product today (just an idea)
  🟩 ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0zne/status/1768381642442510651))
- 100 is your product in 5 years fully validated
  🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩
  if one could wave a magic wand, we would instantly go from 0 to 100
  ⬜️ 🪄 🪄 🪄 🪄 🪄 🪄 🪄 🪄 🪄 🪄 🪄 🟩
  but then MVP wouldn’t be a thing at all.. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0zne/status/1768381645793710519))
- in the real world, going from 0 to 100 takes time & money
  🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 🟧 ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️
  so, our common sense tells us we need some sort of milestone
  in between 0 and 100.
  a milestone that reduces upfront risks...
  this milestone is the MVP ⬛ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0zne/status/1768381649111384514))
- anything you built has a chance to be validated
  🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 ⬛ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️
  the MVP is the embodiment of a hypothetical X risk factor, included between 0 to 100
  when we understand this, there are 2 things to understand about MVPs: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0zne/status/1768381652588544044))
- 1️⃣ MVPs indicate the risk you take
  MVPs aren’t an incomplete version of your final product. A 50% X-value indicates that you are willing to take on half of the risk
  not necessarily that you have to build half of the final thing ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0zne/status/1768381655897768291))
- 2️⃣ X can be “High” or “Low”
  the Lean Startup DOESN’T prescribe the value of "X"
  this decision is up to you, it's influenced by your market, and other criteria for evaluation ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0zne/status/1768381659467161925))
- ex:
  if you think high quality is an MVP requirement, that matters to the point that you won’t have customers, and get feedback otherwise, then you are free to do so
  your MVP would look like this
  ❓ ❓ ❓ ❓ ❓ ❓ ❓ ❓ ❓ ⬛ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0zne/status/1768381662772220298))
- ⬅️ The lower the X
  + the less upfront risk you embark on
  - the less you can validate
  - the less certainty you have toward our final goal
  ➡️ The higher the X
  + the more final assumptions you can validate
  - the higher the cost ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0zne/status/1768381666165440802))
- the MVP is one of the most misunderstood Lean Startup concepts
  it is not the minimum amount of effort possible. It’s what is needed to minimize the risk you want to take
  would love to hear your thoughts on MVPs, and what you think led so many of us to misunderstand it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/0zne/status/1768381669407703048))
- I dropped a few hypotheses on an essay if you're curious

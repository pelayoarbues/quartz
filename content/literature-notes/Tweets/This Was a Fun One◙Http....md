## Highlights
- This was a fun one:

  `cull-instructions` entrypoint for airoboros to merge datasets, remove duplicates, and use LLM to score and filter incorrect/low quality answers, AALLMs, etc.
  Slow, pricey, but very useful for improving quality. https://t.co/GpxpyGpMJe ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jon_durbin/status/1690030869719748608))
- I also removed langchain and Chroma, to use direct embedding calculations with gte-small and faiss index searches.
  It turns out you can calculate embeddings for each text chunk and just average them, and the similarity search is still quite accurate. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jon_durbin/status/1690030870919258112))

- Designed for speed-to-capture & speed-to-action, the overlay makes it easy to execute repetitive work tasks.
  When you pull it up, Embra auto-recommends commands based on your team’s preferences. One person can set up your whole team in just 10-15m!

- And for those who are wondering: you can now upload your own OpenAI keys to your workspace settings!
  This will ensure you don't get rate limited on the GPT-V powered screenshot functionality within Embra.
  You can upload multiple keys for increased reliability. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/zachtratar/status/1726703061857644669))

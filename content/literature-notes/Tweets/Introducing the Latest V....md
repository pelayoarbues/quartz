## Highlights
- Introducing the latest version of our Hermes series of models, Hermes 2 Pro 7B.
  This latest version improves several capabilities, using an updated and cleaned version of the Hermes 2 dataset, and is now trained on a diverse and rich set of function calling and JSON mode samples, thus opening the door to much more reliable and robust agents.

  GGUF versions available here: https://t.co/0rULyxRNiQ
  This work was months in the making, and was built by the efforts and collaboration of [teknium1](https://twitter.com/teknium1), [intrstllrninja](https://twitter.com/intrstllrninja) , [theemozilla](https://twitter.com/theemozilla), [karan4d](https://twitter.com/karan4d), [huemin_art](https://twitter.com/huemin_art), and [FireworksAI_HQ](https://twitter.com/FireworksAI_HQ); thanks as well to [ByteNano](https://twitter.com/ByteNano) and [winglian](https://twitter.com/winglian) for customizing axolotl to support our unique prompt formatting
  A special thanks to [Latitudesh](https://twitter.com/Latitudesh) for sponsoring the compute to make this model.

- This model's function calling capabilities are made possible due to special system prompts and XML Tags, we have made a github repo of sample code for both function calling and JSON mode.

- We also created a custom evaluation framework for Function Calling and JSON Mode, with tests based on the function calling eval dataset made by [FireworksAI_HQ](https://twitter.com/FireworksAI_HQ)
  [intrstllrninja](https://twitter.com/intrstllrninja) created this custom evaluation framework to make our customized pipeline for parsing and handling our format, and the code for that is available on GitHub here: https://t.co/k0heRt5aPE
  The datasets for both Function Calling and for JSON Mode tests are available as well:

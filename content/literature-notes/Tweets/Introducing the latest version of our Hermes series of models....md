## Highlights
- Introducing the latest version of our Hermes series of models, Hermes 2 Pro 7B.
  This latest version improves several capabilities, using an updated and cleaned version of the Hermes 2 dataset, and is now trained on a diverse and rich set of function calling and JSON mode samples, thus opening the door to much more reliable and robust agents.

- This model's function calling capabilities are made possible due to special system prompts and XML Tags, we have made a github repo of sample code for both function calling and JSON mode. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs9j0xyy028337g804dk3g4y))

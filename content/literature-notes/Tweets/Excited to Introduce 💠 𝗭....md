## Highlights
- Excited to introduce 💠 𝗭𝗲𝗻𝗼, an ML evaluation framework for any data or model, from classification to image generation.
  Our goal is to create a standard tool for ML evaluation, like PyTest for testing or PyTorch for model dev.

- The key to 💠 𝗭𝗲𝗻𝗼 is a modular instance view that can be adapted to render any type of data. 
  💠 𝗭𝗲𝗻𝗼 supports most common data types already, and new ones can be added with a single JS file.

## Highlights
- Evaluation of LLM question+answering chains can be challenging: here's @huggingface space to automate this. Upload doc(s) and select a QA chain configuration you want to test. The app builds the chain (w/ @LangChainAI), grades it, and logs results for you.

- ... in the app, you can choose retrievers (e.g., SVM - idea c/o @karpathy, kNN, TF-IDF), chain params, models (GPT4/3.5, @AnthropicAI), and prompts for model-graded evaluation of answers (incl the grading prompt open-sourced by @OpenAI, see more here): https://t.co/7uWg3faNFC ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/RLanceMartin/status/1654893919585570816))
- ... since many don't have access to GPT4 or Anthropic, we also have a hosted app c/o @LangChainAI that is free to use.

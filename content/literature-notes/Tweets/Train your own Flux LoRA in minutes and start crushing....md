## Highlights
- To create your own LoRA and have it ready anytime, we’ll use Replicate and Huggingface—both great for hosting and running models in the cloud. This tutorial is based on [@Valen](https://twitter.com/Valen) awesome YT guide and big thanks to [@ramonteleco](https://twitter.com/ramonteleco) for sharing it with me too!

- First, head over to [@replicate](https://twitter.com/replicate) and create an account. Once you're in, click on "Explore" and search for the model "lucataco/ai-toolkit." After selecting it, click on "Train" and create a new model. Give it a simple name—we'll need it later. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j8mzs2m5mnkzh336bt022fph))
- Next, gather 10-12 photos of yourself in different poses, settings, and outfits. Rename each file as "a_photo_of_" plus your model’s name and a number (01, 02…). Compress them into a zip file named "photos_of_" plus your model’s name. Upload the zip in the images section ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j8mzsc7a06vah6h6pn5p1gb1))
- Alright, now we need the token from [@huggingface](https://twitter.com/huggingface). Go to your account (create one if you don’t have it), then in Settings, select Access Tokens. Create a new token with sufficient permissions and copy it. You’ll paste this token later in the corresponding section on Replicate.

- Before we continue, keep in mind that there’s a cost involved. Training the model costs around $2.50, and each generation afterward is about $0.05. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j8mztapcccvtg4y2bjr0w9j9))

## Highlights
- Achieving restorative sleep is essential for health, yet many people turn to melatonin or prescription medications. Passion flower (Passiflora incarnata), with its natural properties and gentle action, offers a compelling alternative.

- **GABA Enhancement**: Passion flower promotes sleep by elevating gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the brain, facilitating relaxation and reducing nervous system excitability. This contrasts with the often more forceful action of synthetic sleep aids, which might lead to dependency ([Phytotherapy Research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ptr.3400)).

- **Lower Side Effect Profile**: Generally well-tolerated, passion flower occasionally causes mild side effects like dizziness or confusion. Conversely, sleep medications and melatonin can cause next-day drowsiness and other more significant effects ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5699852/)).

- **Reduced Dependency Risk**: The gentle action of passion flower minimizes the risk of dependency. In contrast, long-term use of melatonin can disrupt the bodyâ€™s natural hormonal balance, and prescription sleep aids might lead to rebound insomnia or addiction.

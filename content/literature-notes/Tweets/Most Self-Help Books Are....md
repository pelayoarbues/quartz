## Highlights
- Most self-help books are a waste of time.
  Mildly interesting, but filled with unhelpful, tedious fluff.
  I know, I've read 200+ of them.
  Here are the 9 personal growth books that will CHANGE YOUR LIFE: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ABetterJones/status/1624815639943872512))
- All of these books have the power to shift your thinking and change the direction of your life.
  Each has a different focus, however.
  - Courage
  - Leadership
  - Self-awareness
  - Creating impact
  - Finding your purpose
  Decide how you want to change YOUR life + choose accordingly. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ABetterJones/status/1624815642636603392))
- If you're not sure where to start, begin with Insight by Tasha Eurich.
  She teaches you:
  - What self-awareness is
  - Why you're less aware than you think
  - Why it's the SECRET to success in life
  - What you're doing to sabotage it
  - How to cultivate yours

- If you haven't read Brené Brown's seminal work, Daring Greatly, stop everything you're doing and read it.

  - Happiness
  - Connection
  - Freedom from shame

  And a really smart one.
  And teaches you simple, actionable steps to create it for yourself.

- Examining our implicit biases is awkward and painful.
  But it's a critical step to dismantling their impact on us.
  Dr. Eberhardt weaves together illuminating research with heart-breaking stories to paint a DAMNING picture of the way bias shapes our world.
  MUST read.

- In Reboot, Jerry Colonna, the "CEO Whisperer" shares how as leaders, our weaknesses are often reflections of un-examined pain from our past.
  The solution?
  Radical self-inquiry to understand the forces that shaped our lives.
  Read this if you want to elevate your leadership.

- When I ask about life-changing books, Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl is the #1 suggestion.
  Frankl shares his harrowing survival of the holocaust.
  He explains that we all search for meaning in life.
  Once we find it, we can survive anything.
  Prepare to be inspired.

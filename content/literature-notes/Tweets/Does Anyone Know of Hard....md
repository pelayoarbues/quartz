## Highlights
- Does anyone know of hard large-scale data (not anecdotes!) on the impact of AI image generation on employment for people in visual arts?
  That is, news of significant overall changes in employment in some large subsector of the market for visual art
  (This might mean a downward shift, it might mean an expansion - e.g., decades in the past, tools like Photoshop didn't substitute for designers, they changed what design is, and actually expanded the market for designers. Maybe generative AI will do something similar for some types of visual art)
  Please don't reply with stories about that one guy your sister knows who [etc], I've heard dozens (at least) of such stories. Even stories about so-and-so-a-small-media outlet don't tell us much about the overall changes. Was it 100 graphic artists? 10,000? Were they rehired later?

- Worth noting: Midjourney is now more than two years old. And I remember so much hype about how tools like this were going to cause mass unemployment for artists, don't send your kids to art school, etc. I suspect some of those stories have now been falsified. And I wonder what to learn? And what that means for tools like Sora ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1774194317042815358))
- I personally use the tools quite a bit, though I've never used them to substitute for what would otherwise be paid labour. And, of course, my results are far inferior to what even a moderately talented artist would do - in particular, their taste and imaginative sense of what is possible greatly exceeds mine
  Right now the interface primitives remain extremely clunky - indeed, I'd go so far as to say "bad" - and until that has improved a lot I'd be surprised by widespread use. However: I also expect such improvements will gradually come, and the tools will become more and more useful, especially in the hands of skilled artists
  I remain in awe of the many artists who have done astonishing things with such models, going back to GANs a decade ago, and even further ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1774195687229648962))

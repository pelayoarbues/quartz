## Highlights
- Hers's a hack I use when Stakeholders come with solutions, NOT problems.
  Don't work backwards, work forward.
  What do I mean by that?
  Commonly when a stakeholder comes w/ a solution we try to get them to work backwards to the problem.
  But for some this is a stretch.

- We hit a wall, there's resistance. The Stakeholder can't understand why they need to give a problem, when they have this amazing solution idea (after all it's an awesome idea, right?)
  So instead of trying to work against their thinking, go with it.

- Look forward not backwards.
  Ask: "If we did deliver this solution, what does it mean?"
  ...what does it mean for us, the org, our users?
  Rather than trying to get them to articulate the problem, get them to think about what would be true if we did deliver their solution.

- Here's a real example I did this with:
  Idea: "move DB to cloud"
  What does this mean for us/org/customers:
  Speed, reduce costs, reduce complexity, Improved experience
  Why do we need these outcomes:
  Costly to run, delays, slow processing, etc.
  BOOM Problem spaces!üí•

- Side bar, I also used all of the above to identify assumptions to start the conversation on discovery... turned into a full blown assumptions map and then a discovery backlog.
  Something that wouldn't have happened otherwise.

## Highlights
- ðŸš¨ New publicly available dataset on housing regulations across US municipalities
  With [AlexBartik](https://twitter.com/AlexBartik) and [DMilo75](https://twitter.com/DMilo75), we highlight a novel AI-based method for accurate categorization of regulations in unstructured text, which we use to establish 5 facts about housing regulation:

- 1âƒ£ US housing production disproportionately happens in unincorporated areas
  Bulk of US housing production, including a majority in the South, happens in these mostly greenfield, exurban developments outside cities that are far from jobs and amenities, but allow more housing.

- 2âƒ£Housing regulation limits density. This happens through:
  â€¢ Bans on building or converting to mutlifamily buildings 
  â€¢Â Single-family zoning 
  â€¢Â Minimum lot size requirements. 7% of munis have a smallest lot size above half-acre, and 42% have a largest lot size above half-acre

- 3âƒ£ Zoning is more restrictive of density in suburban areas, particularly in the Northeast
  Northeast has country has some of the highest lot size requirements.
  Even CA does not have crazy bulk regulations â€”Â the West instead use housing process more to regulate housing.

- 4âƒ£ Housing regulations can be organized into two principal components. The first associates with higher housing demand and is associated with rent extraction in Blue cities. 
  ie affordable housing mandates and incentives, which redistribute away from developers to locals.

- 5âƒ£The second regulatory PC identifies exclusionary zoning. These are bulk regulations like frontage, minimum lot size requirements, and public hearing requirements which restrict the entry of lower income people, resulting in income and racial segregation.

- Our approach can be adapted to measure regulations in other contexts, and to create structured datasets out of unstructured text more broadly. This opens up large amounts of text for formal analysis. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/arpitrage/status/1835656162253115588))

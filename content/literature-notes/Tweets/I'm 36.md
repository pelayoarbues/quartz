## Highlights
- The Physiological Sigh:
  One of the fastest ways to calm down.
  • 1 deep inhale through the nose 
  • 1 short inhale to top up 
  • 1 long exhale to empty lungs
  Just 1-3 cycles emphasizing the exhale will offload the max amount of CO2, slow your heart rate & relax you in real time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja3tr47gtr2hkxwyfxt4g15c))
- Mel Robbins' 5-Second Rule:
  To break the cycle of anxiety and change your stress habits, simply count down from 5.

- curate your thoughts.
  Run them through Jon Acuff's 3 filters:
  • Is it true? 
  • Is it helpful? 
  • Is it kind?
  If they're not accurate, not serving you and making you feel worse...
  Discard them immediately.

- To perform at your best, you gotta visualize success.
  Imagine mastering your situation with vivid clarity.

  Regularly rehearse this scenario to reinforce those circuits ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja3ts833r0jnsqb9nvs9f4gs))
- Tim Ferriss' Fear-Setting Exercise:
  Conquer your fears by knowing them.
  • Define your fears for clarity 
  • Brainstorm prevention 
  • Plan for damage repair 
  • List the benefits of taking action 
  • Consider the costs of inaction ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja3tvrbw01rggkrehbremrgj))
- Our brains tend to:
  • Ignore the high costs of our inaction 
  • Understate the positive results of taking action 
  • Exaggerate negative consequences of taking action ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja3tw7y2mc4vjxka51s3djjs))
- Conquer your fear of judgment:
  Choosing attachment (fitting in) over authenticity (being yourself) sets you up for long-term health issues.
  Caring what people think is costing you your health.
  So to hell with others' opinions.
  Being healthy > seeking approval. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja3tyjx1xs3drvh9abtxwk6r))

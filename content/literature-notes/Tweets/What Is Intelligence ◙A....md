## Highlights
- What is intelligence? 
  And how is it different from problem solving? 
  These questions are central in our current discussion on AI & were debated passionately this week at the Santa Fe Institute‚Äôs conference on collective intelligence.
  But what did we learn?

- First, a disclaimer. In this thread I will focus on one idea, not all the ideas discussed in the conference, and will obviate other aspects of intelligence (eg multidimensional intelligence), not because these are not important, but because I want to communicate one point. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cesifoti/status/1672992171807449088))
- My focus will be on a distinction between intelligence & problem solving, because in my experience, when people are pushed to define intelligence on the fly they often gravitate towards a problem solving definitions of intelligence. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cesifoti/status/1672992176869892097))
- But since solving the wrong problem can be hardly called intelligent, there must be something else going on.
  To illustrate this point I‚Äôll use the story of an extremely talented problem solver: Steve Williams, the star of the documentary Jurassic Punk.

- Steve was not a regular computer geek. He was a classic late 80s rebel who was great at computer graphics, physics, and math. 
  In the late 80s he joined Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), a renowned special effects studio.

- At ILM Steve worked on the iconic ‚Äúwater worm‚Äù scene from The Abyss, figuring out how to make something that looked like a living body of water using a 1980s silicon graphics computer.

- His next job was Terminator 2, a movie where special effects played a central role. 
  Steve was essential for the creation of the T-1000, the liquid metal cop that blew everyone‚Äôs mind. ü§Ø

- The next big project for ILM was Jurassic Park, a movie in which computer graphics were expected to play a more muted role. 
  The original plan was to use animatronics & stop motion for the close ups, leaving computer graphics only for the far away scenes.

- But Steve insisted on doing the special effects in silico, and when he was ignored, he started to build a T-Rex skeleton in his own time. 
  When James Cameron‚Äôs team visited ILM, Steve left his T-Rex skeleton video running on a loop, so they could not avoid seeing it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cesifoti/status/1672992234378088448))
- This triggered a cascade of events that ended up changing the production of the movie, leading to the decision of doing all special effects in silico. 
  And the bet paid off, in 1993, Steve‚Äôs effects again blew everyone‚Äôs mind. ü§Øü§Ø

- Steve Williams was by all means a brilliant problem solver pushing the boundary of what was considered possible. But he might have taken for granted the fact that he was working on the right problems thanks to the choices of a brilliant problem finder: James Cameron. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cesifoti/status/1672992251834662912))
- Eventually, Steve became disgruntled with ILM, and for a good reason. The special effects director of Terminator 2 and Jurassic Park, his manager Dennis Muren, didn‚Äôt mention him when receiving the special effects Oscars won by these movies thanks to Steve‚Äôs great work.

- Steve‚Äôs rebel attitude & lose lip with the press eventually ended in his departure from ILM. 
  He found temporary success doing commercials, but his directorial debut for a Disney animated film didn‚Äôt go well.
  Things went south for him after that.

- Steve‚Äôs story poignantly illustrates that intelligence cannot be reduced purely to problem solving. After all, solving the wrong problem is not very intelligent. If intelligence involves some choice and agency, then a key aspect of intelligence must be problem setting. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cesifoti/status/1672992274186137601))
- But problem setting is very different from problem solving. 
  Problem solving is somehow ‚Äúeasier‚Äù because, given a goal, it is always possible to evaluate a solution. 
  That means problem solving can be reduced to a search over a space of possible solutions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cesifoti/status/1672992279340916739))
- But problem setting cannot be explored, or at least not that easily, because to explore each goal in the same way would require solving each one of the chosen problems. 
  That makes problem setting by definition much slower and difficult to explore than problem solving. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cesifoti/status/1672992284533571584))
- In organizations these two forms of intelligence are usually combined. 
  Individual contributors (like Steve at ILM) are problem solvers. Creative leaders (like James Cameron) are problem setters or problem choosers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cesifoti/status/1672992289973583872))
- These two forms of complementary intelligence contribute to an organizations collective intelligence. 
  A well chosen problem doesn‚Äôt work without a strong execution, and working hard to solve the wrong problem is hardly intelligent. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cesifoti/status/1672992295296065537))
- But these two intelligences do not operate at the same scales.
  Problem choosers need teams, and managers to coordinate these teams. They operate at a collective/architectural scale. 
  Problem solvers are focused on more narrowly defined tasks, operating at the component scale. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cesifoti/status/1672992300501270528))
- Problem solvers and problem choosers also operate at different temporal scales.
  Solving defined problems is more short term than choosing problems to solve. 
  This makes problem solving and problem choosing complements across organizational and temporal scales. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cesifoti/status/1672992304792059904))
- Finally, I should mention that this conference was not the first to acknowledge the role of problem choosing on intelligence. 
  In philosophy, the concept of abductive reasoning or abduction‚Äîin contrast to deduction & induction‚Äîis used to describe the generation of hypotheses. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cesifoti/status/1672992310244540416))
- The point is that, once you realize that problem setting plays a key role on intelligence, you cannot go back to definitions of intelligence focused purely on problem solving. 
  The mysticism of problem solving is broken in this light. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cesifoti/status/1672992315672018945))
- Overall, this week at Santa Fe was an stimulating adventure, allowing me to reconnect with colleagues & with the US (it was my first visit since I moved to Europe in 2021). 
  I hope that this thread spreads some of the inspiration I was lucky to get at this awesome event.

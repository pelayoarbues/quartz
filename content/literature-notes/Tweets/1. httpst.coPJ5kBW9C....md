## Highlights
- 1. https://t.co/PJ5kBW9CnF So Cosma Shalizi and I have a piece in the Economist on shoggoths. The Large Language Models driving ChatGPT and Bing are indeed Lovecraftian monsters. But so too are markets, bureaucracies, and even democracy, if squinted at askance.

- 2. The idea is straightforward. Like @AlisonGopnik we don't see LLMs as analogous to individual human intelligences. Instead, they're "cultural technologies" - systems for summarizing human created knowledge and making it useful. This puts the shoggoth meme in a different context ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/henryfarrell/status/1671547595485847552))
- 3. People like @kevinroose see the shoggoth as terrifying because it is a reinforcement-learning smiley face superimposed on a heaving, amorphous and fundamentally inhuman monstrosity. That's right. But the crawling chaos behind the mask is the product of human knowledge. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/henryfarrell/status/1671547602788143108))
- 4. It is a set of weighted vectors which summarize and represent an enormous corpus of text that has been fed through a transformer. In other words, it is a seething mass of human intelligence, seen from an alien (what Lovecraft would call a "cosmic") perspective. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/henryfarrell/status/1671547604495134722))
- 5. The point is that this is _nothing new._ Here, we're riffing on a fantastic piece that Cosma wrote a decade ago, arguing that markets and bureaucracies were vast, inhuman distributed systems of information-processing "the coldest of all cold monsters" https://t.co/Mj2IRMLEi8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/henryfarrell/status/1671547607217209346))
- 6. See also @cstross on corporations as "Slow AI." https://t.co/ROltSbNDVZ . The market too is an inchoate mass of complex human information, which is, simplified, represented and made tractable by the price mechanism. That's Hayek's argument for why markets beat bureaucracy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/henryfarrell/status/1671547609763266562))
- 7. And bureaucracies too are monsters of information, that devour complex, rich webs of local knowledge, and spit out the thin abstract categories which allow the state to "see" the society that it seeks to govern and control. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/henryfarrell/status/1671547612707577857))
- 8. Both Hayek and Scott recognize that markets and bureaucracies are inhuman systems - they do not and _cannot_ care about human values like justice. Hayek proclaims this, and Scott condemns it. The same is even true of democracies. We talk about the democratic "public." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/henryfarrell/status/1671547614746009602))
- 9. But we cannot see the true vast, inchoate system of quasi-amorphous beliefs and values that the mass of citizens hold. All we can see is the thinly sketched outlines of opinion polls, voting results and the like. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/henryfarrell/status/1671547616750972929))
- 10. As we put it, "we’ve lived among shoggoths for centuries, tending to them as though they were our masters. We call them “the market system”, “bureaucracy” and even “electoral democracy”." Now, we have a new shoggoth - the Large Language Model. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/henryfarrell/status/1671547618600550408))
- 11. In other words, we have a new vast distributed system that represents and simplifies the enormous chaos of human knowledge, and turns it into a source of power. That gets us away from the silly debates about whether LLMs or other kinds of machine learning are intelligent. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/henryfarrell/status/1671547621075308546))
- 12. They are intelligent in precisely the same way as markets and bureaucracies are intelligent - that is, they are systems for processing human intelligence and making it more useful. So too, their consequences for human society are not those of an utterly alien power ... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/henryfarrell/status/1671547622719356928))
- 13. but of all of us, collectively, passed through a distorting prism. The fundamental problem of the last two centuries has been one of figuring out space for human agency and freedom in the spaces between the great shoggoths of the industrial revolution. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/henryfarrell/status/1671547624392982535))
- 14. Those shoggoths have been put to enormous tasks. We could not live without markets and bureaucracy, or have collective agency without some kind of democracy. Equally, these vast systems are uncaring and brutal if you find yourself on the wrong end of them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/henryfarrell/status/1671547626330701827))
- 15. And their weight crushes some groups, while resting feather light on others. We need to understand LLMs not as a gate to the Singularity, or better, as Cosma puts it, we need to understand that the Singularity already happened centuries ago, when these systems first emerged. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/henryfarrell/status/1671547627874185219))
- 16. Just as we fight over markets, bureaucracy and democracy, and set one to limit the encroachments of the others, we need to understand how LLMs change the balance, how they might be deployed, and what ought be deployed against them. Finis. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/henryfarrell/status/1671547629535211526))

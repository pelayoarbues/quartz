Then it goes with a description of the main elements of CrewAI that you can check from the first course

A new addition is the ability to create Agents and Tasks using yaml files. 

## Automate Project: Planning, Estimation and Allocation


| Agents                | Tasks               |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Project Planner       | Task breakdown      |
| Estimation Analyst    | Time Estimation     |
| Allocation Strategist | Resource allocation |

The output will be a project plan with tasks/allocations and milestones with the people responsible. Eventually we will be able to push the project to Trello or Jira.

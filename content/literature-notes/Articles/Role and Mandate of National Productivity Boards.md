## Highlights
- National Productivity Boards are independent institutions that help to analyse economic productivity and competitiveness developments and challenges. [All euro area countries are invited to have such boards, while other EU countries are encouraged to do so](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016H0924%2801%29).

- The boards will carry out high quality economic and statistical analysis and make their results available in the public domain. In this way they make a valuable contribution to policy debates in their countries and encourage reforms aimed at achieving sustainable economic growth and convergence. National Productivity Boards may consult relevant stakeholders, though they are required to be objective and neutral. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je21b8x0x58bnc4e5qrcnzhw))

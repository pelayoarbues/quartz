## Highlights
- was found that ImageNet had over 100k mislabeled images.
  Real-world datasets are messy.
  They often come with noisy labels, missing values, and outliers that can severely degrade your model’s performance.
  No sophisticated ML algorithms can compensate for poor-quality or mislabeled data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb04zs73sgem7j4rr750dnyf))

- Researchers from MIT developed **[Cleanlab](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/index.html)**, which is an open-source library that cleans your data in just a few lines of code. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb04zzdchyjpjwj9bd32a677))
- As shown in the image above, **[Cleanlab](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/index.html)** can flag errors in any type of data (text, image, tabular, audio), like:
  • out-of-distribution samples
  • outliers
  • label issues
  • duplicates, etc.
  All it takes is just four lines of code:

  • Import the package.
  • Pass the dataset and specify the label column.
  • Find issues by passing the embedding matrix and the probabilities predicted by the model.
  • Finally, generate the report!
  Done!
  It will generate a report like the one shown above.
  This way, you can easily clean your datasets for training accurate ML models. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb050g4pa87ztpcra15ghb4x))

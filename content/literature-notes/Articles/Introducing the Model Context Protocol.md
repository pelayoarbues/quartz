## Highlights
- Today, we're open-sourcing the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP), a new standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems where data lives, including content repositories, business tools, and development environments. Its aim is to help frontier models produce better, more relevant responses. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je20sawpgh575y1n82ecytp9))
- As AI assistants gain mainstream adoption, the industry has invested heavily in model capabilities, achieving rapid advances in reasoning and quality. Yet even the most sophisticated models are constrained by their isolation from data—trapped behind information silos and legacy systems. Every new data source requires its own custom implementation, making truly connected systems difficult to scale. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je20sg379ev7byn8180nt08r))
- MCP addresses this challenge. It provides a universal, open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources, replacing fragmented integrations with a single protocol. The result is a simpler, more reliable way to give AI systems access to the data they need. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je20sj738dxkke08kwvr70tx))
- The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet is adept at quickly building MCP server implementations, making it easy for organizations and individuals to rapidly connect their most important datasets with a range of AI-powered tools. To help developers start exploring, we’re sharing pre-built MCP servers for popular enterprise systems like Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, Git, Postgres, and Puppeteer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je20t1mq83m5g2kkn0hc179t))
- Early adopters like Block and Apollo have integrated MCP into their systems, while development tools companies including Zed, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph are working with MCP to enhance their platforms—enabling AI agents to better retrieve relevant information to further understand the context around a coding task and produce more nuanced and functional code with fewer attempts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je20tbjyjyw9h5ve6350pz8n))
- Instead of maintaining separate connectors for each data source, developers can now build against a standard protocol. As the ecosystem matures, AI systems will maintain context as they move between different tools and datasets, replacing today's fragmented integrations with a more sustainable architecture. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je20tq0xwc3kbpkd675cqqgd))
- Developers can start building and testing MCP connectors today. Existing Claude for Work customers can begin testing MCP servers locally, connecting Claude to internal systems and datasets. We'll soon provide developer toolkits for deploying remote production MCP servers that can serve your entire Claude for Work organization.

## Highlights
- OpenAI will begin to resemble Google more than DeepMind (search, browser, devices, hardware, robotics; not just AI software like GPTs and o1/o3) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5e5nnz0bfzbt5a9asmfzv1))
- The US government will create the first AGI-centered national security project to face China’s alleged threat, collaborating with leading AI companies (including Big Tech). BRICS will follow suit (perhaps not in 2025) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5e5t22h81bs35jkfahbpmf))
- At least one AI product will cost upward of $2000/month ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5e5wt5a5vrycye8aamy2tf))
- There won’t be an AI winter (defined, using historical figures of previous winter periods, by a reduction in total investment in the generative AI industry below 20% of the previous year) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5e62tkeknxx362sjsmtd6m))
- Leading research will move on from pure pre-trained large language models into overlooked avenues like search-based intelligence, test-time training, test-time thinking, and, to a lesser degree, non-transformer architectures ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5e681fxywc5dmpsv1sk6kg))
- ARC-AGI (v1 *and* v2) and FrontierMath benchmarks won’t be solved 100% regardless of the time/money spent ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5e6c6tjzh4tn2kcet058tm))
- There won’t be mass unemployment due to AI (employment rates will remain stable throughout 2025, at least regarding AI progress) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5e6f5vw9yshf2chme8j2df))
- The ceiling of AI capabilities will rise beyond the superhuman level in coding/math/science (i.e. at least Terence Tao level in math) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5e6m7h8awnwdq4hrgs4xvw))
- One or various of the big AI labs will put ads into their products ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5e6yw4nmwnw8trbfp37gt9))
- OpenAI’s revenue, dominated by individual users (>60%), will shift towards businesses (B2B), better positioned to afford premium offerings like ChatGPT Pro ($200/month), which will be increasingly more common as we approach AGI ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5e7281dx69h8cva5b30s4j))
- Google will either acquire, acqui-hire, or *kill* Magic (long context windows) and/or Perplexity (AI search) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5e768g0x8038ky97py1anj))
- Google and DeepMind will be broadly considered the leaders of the AI race toward AGI over OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta by the end of 2025 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5e7dyesb91k1c9vyftc0nc))
- An AI-generated movie (featurette length at least) will win an award ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5e7j8jy1ejkajnmb7wrt8v))
- Hallucinations won’t be solved; the most advanced model created in 2025 will still make factual mistakes that no human would make ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5e7mq2e46zqqvswsgympxb))
- The generative AI financial bubble will pop (reflected in stock graphs and bankruptcy fillings), elevating a few winners (e.g. OpenAI, Google) into an unbreakable oligopoly ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5e7qkaha5tm3aygtv0h683))
- At least a major news outlet (e.g. NYT) will claim China is on par with (or above) the US on most fronts: research, development, manufacturing, and productization—with the possible exception of innovation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5e7sym2me5c6p3g8xr7dzw))

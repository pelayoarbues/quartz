## Highlights
- Fortunately, my writer’s block disappeared once I started **Writing from Abundance**.
  The premise is simple — build a bank of inspiration while you’re away from the computer and *before* you sit down to write. Capture your epiphanies. Save the best quotes you read. Identify ideas that resonate with you and jot them down as notes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrkx6622fnv6stav24rvd7))
- Writing from Abundance is the art of collecting ideas so you never have to write from scratch. It’s about living a life that brims with inspiration. That inspiration can come from external sources—like social media, articles, or books. It can also come from internal sources– like dinner parties, work meetings, or shower thoughts. If you capture ideas when they’re in the forefront of your mind, you won’t have to pray for them to come back when it’s time to write.

- Once I learned to Write from Abundance, I saw how the practice was alive in many fields. I last saw them when I visited my tailor and asked him for help making a blazer. Instead of starting from scratch, he put a bunch of materials on the table (silk, buttons, swatches, etc.). Then he mixed and matched the possibilities until a design emerged. Your notes are like those raw materials. If you ever get stuck, you can pour them onto the page and see what materializes when your ideas collide.

- Every great writer I know obsessively curates their information diet. They rightfully know that high-quality writing begins with good taste for what you consume. Writing is like cooking. If you walk into a Michelin Star restaurant and ask the chef: “What’s the fastest way to improve the quality of your food?” they’ll likely say: “Better ingredients.” At the end of the day, heaps of dressing can’t make up for stale lettuce. A salad can only be as good as the fruits and vegetables inside of it. Your experiences, conversations, and information sources contain the raw ingredients for your writing.

- It’s easier to have unique ideas when you read things other people don’t. Early in his career, Warren Buffett got some of his edge by going beyond the Annual Reports that everybody else was reading and picking up 10-K filings that were tough to get your hands on back then. David Epstein aims to read ten journal articles per day when he’s working on a book. Many of his best ideas come from reading papers that others won’t and synthesizing them for a public audience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrpfqr86cmw1j7y5r8pvbm))
- Beware of too much news consumption. Yes, it’s good to be an informed citizen. But the idea that obsessively reading the news is the best way to stay informed is a lie sold to us by the propaganda machine. Most news is inconsequential. It’s entertainment dressed up as information. Though it can be good to have a general sense of what’s happening in society, you probably don’t need to be plugged into a 24/7 stream of news — or what I call: the Never-Ending Now. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrq6yndnc2gey14g0zvkq2))
- I succumb to the same impulse. Chances are, so do you. Like hamsters running on a wheel, we live in an endless cycle of ephemeral content consumption — a merry-go-round that spins faster and faster but barely goes anywhere. The Internet is a novelty machine that pulls us away from age-old wisdom. Even though we’re just a click away from the greatest authors of all time, from Plato to Tolstoy, we default to novelty instead of timelessness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrrsd38hrg3frka3gmkjm3))
- We’re trapped in a Never-Ending Now — blind to history, engulfed in the present moment, overwhelmed by the slightest breeze of chaos. Here’s the bottom line: You should prioritize the accumulated wisdom of humanity over what’s trending on Twitter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrs25b34nbv4e5a0dxm9vd))
- **Short-form**: Social media is at its best when it matches you with people who share your exact interests and teach you about what you want to write about. Unfollow celebrities. Replace them with people who make you smarter and bring long-lasting joy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrv9thqg5pz3jtvnq2yh0g))
- **Medium-form**: Read less of the news. Subscribe to magazines and YouTube channels that post timeless ideas. Read essays and speeches that have stood the test of time. Find people whose recommendations you consistently enjoy and subscribe to their newsletters. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrvg789qgcxg92kxmtrrxp))
- **Long-form**: Get away from your screen and read more books. If it helps, start a book club. Find classic books to read. Watch old documentaries and listen to lecture series. Crawl the Internet for college syllabuses so you can read them on your own time.1 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrvj5rf9yp1faw86ksf5zd))
- Now that your incoming information is solid, you need a way to harness it. It’s not enough just to binge eBooks and list a stat on your website (one Write of Passage student refers to this as [“Book](https://www.camiloms.com/musings/book-chugging) [Chugging](https://www.camiloms.com/musings/book-chugging).”) You should save the best parts of what you read, so you can easily reference them later. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrw0hg17wk62vv00fhvpzf))
- Notes are so central to my writing process that writing without them is like building a campfire without a pile of wood. Because I’m so diligent about writing ideas down, I don’t need to run back to the “forest” every time I get stuck. Instead of starting a new research process for each new article, I pull from ideas I’ve already captured in my casual reading, in conversations, and in the ordinary moments of my life. All those notes became intellectual fodder for future pieces. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrw4kp2wg4gsvh806w0z4e))
- I call this process “**Ambient Research**.” By the time I sit down to write about a topic, I’ve already done most of the research I need to write about it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrwjpj6662ska01qg2gkkg))
- This method of Ambient Research is the opposite of what I learned in school. My teachers promoted Active Research, which led me to spend hours reading in the library after I picked a topic. Without notes to build upon, I had to start from scratch whenever I began an essay. Since I’m a slow reader, I had to give up my weekends for research.

- Effective ambient research happens when you capture the best ideas you consume, the epiphanies you have, and the things you’ve already written to friends and colleagues. I’ll focus on each in the next three sections. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbryp5g2cmbzgqg4hy38pac))
- I never read articles in my web browser. When I come across an interesting article, I save it to an app that automatically downloads it to my phone so I can read it later. Saving these articles gets me out of a reactivity loop, where I read things immediately after I find them (which is what most people do). I want my reading to be much more intentional than that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrz1g6r68km5pgkrtk5dnv))
- Read-it-Later apps act as a quality filter for your reading too. By saving articles to an app and refusing to instantly read things you come across on the Internet, you raise the bar for what grabs your attention. With a Read-it-Later app, whenever you sit down to read, you have hundreds of articles to choose from. You can allocate your attention to the best one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbs0eyb03qd9zp1y2cy8tkb))
- Many of your unique and provocative ideas will come when you’re away from the computer — doing chores, driving around, or walking through your neighborhood. Ideas are fickle. That’s why so many of history’s greatest writers have walked around with a notepad. When I read about the writing processes of historians, they repeatedly talk about how they capture their impressions *immediately* after an interview ends, while their memories are still sharp. They know that ideas that seem obvious in the moment will be forgotten by the time they’re ready to write about them. Following their lead, whenever I have an important idea, I assume I won’t remember it and write it down as soon as possible.

- Note-taking is the closest thing we have to time travel. It’s rebellion against the entropy of memory. Kendrick Lamar insists that much of the “writing” for his lyrics happens in the note-taking process. In one interview, he [said](https://www.gq.com/video/watch/watch-kendrick-lamar-meet-rick-rubin-and-have-an-epic-conversation): “I have to write them down and then five or three months later, I have to find that same emotion that I felt when I was inspired by it, so I have to dig deep to see what triggered the idea… It comes back because I have key little words that make me realize the exact emotion which drew the inspiration.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbs2chr2fwtvvy01qkk2byf))
- Your ability to transcribe an event is better than your ability to remember it. Writing down your observations makes you more observant, and once you commit to capturing them, your brain generates more of them. It’s like photography. Putting a camera in your hands turns every moment into a photo opportunity, which makes you more aware of your surroundings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbs2r3w7tkwh379fk4kv7qf))
- Likewise, I often find that I’ve written parts of my piece without realizing it, either in emails to friends or Slack messages to colleagues. Sometimes, I’ll even search my tweet history. I’ve made a habit out of saving anything substantial I write to a central note-taking system so I can easily retrieve it in the future. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbs9fas6q986e0s9x10qqm3))
- The brain is great at creating connections, but terrible at remembering specific details (which is what computers are uniquely good at). Note-taking works best when the ideas are saved in a central location that contains the best reading and [thinking](https://perell.com/essay/how-philosophers-think/) you’ve ever done. The easier it is to search those notes, the faster you’ll be able to find them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsb1ycjcntwt84nwz8pezg))
- Though note-taking has been transformative for many writers, it’s telling that none of the best writers I know have a perfect note-taking system. They make something that works (even if it’s duct-taped together), and get on with what’s important: actually writing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsbh2hqaepj9b27j67jx4p))
- **he point of taking notes is to write, not to have the perfect note-taking system.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsce9hhyd85fwv510d8hd1))

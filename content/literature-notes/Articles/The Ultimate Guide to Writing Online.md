## Highlights
- Fortunately, my writer’s block disappeared once I started **Writing from Abundance**.
  The premise is simple — build a bank of inspiration while you’re away from the computer and *before* you sit down to write. Capture your epiphanies. Save the best quotes you read. Identify ideas that resonate with you and jot them down as notes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrkx6622fnv6stav24rvd7))
- Writing from Abundance is the art of collecting ideas so you never have to write from scratch. It’s about living a life that brims with inspiration. That inspiration can come from external sources—like social media, articles, or books. It can also come from internal sources– like dinner parties, work meetings, or shower thoughts. If you capture ideas when they’re in the forefront of your mind, you won’t have to pray for them to come back when it’s time to write. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrm8s0cafw1389v8bqd3kp))
- Once I learned to Write from Abundance, I saw how the practice was alive in many fields. I last saw them when I visited my tailor and asked him for help making a blazer. Instead of starting from scratch, he put a bunch of materials on the table (silk, buttons, swatches, etc.). Then he mixed and matched the possibilities until a design emerged. Your notes are like those raw materials. If you ever get stuck, you can pour them onto the page and see what materializes when your ideas collide. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrn036vk5m2cfq4ps8xag9))
- Every great writer I know obsessively curates their information diet. They rightfully know that high-quality writing begins with good taste for what you consume. Writing is like cooking. If you walk into a Michelin Star restaurant and ask the chef: “What’s the fastest way to improve the quality of your food?” they’ll likely say: “Better ingredients.” At the end of the day, heaps of dressing can’t make up for stale lettuce. A salad can only be as good as the fruits and vegetables inside of it. Your experiences, conversations, and information sources contain the raw ingredients for your writing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrnns3jej58ef5v3ag33me))
- It’s easier to have unique ideas when you read things other people don’t. Early in his career, Warren Buffett got some of his edge by going beyond the Annual Reports that everybody else was reading and picking up 10-K filings that were tough to get your hands on back then. David Epstein aims to read ten journal articles per day when he’s working on a book. Many of his best ideas come from reading papers that others won’t and synthesizing them for a public audience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrpfqr86cmw1j7y5r8pvbm))
- Beware of too much news consumption. Yes, it’s good to be an informed citizen. But the idea that obsessively reading the news is the best way to stay informed is a lie sold to us by the propaganda machine. Most news is inconsequential. It’s entertainment dressed up as information. Though it can be good to have a general sense of what’s happening in society, you probably don’t need to be plugged into a 24/7 stream of news — or what I call: the Never-Ending Now. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrq6yndnc2gey14g0zvkq2))
- I succumb to the same impulse. Chances are, so do you. Like hamsters running on a wheel, we live in an endless cycle of ephemeral content consumption — a merry-go-round that spins faster and faster but barely goes anywhere. The Internet is a novelty machine that pulls us away from age-old wisdom. Even though we’re just a click away from the greatest authors of all time, from Plato to Tolstoy, we default to novelty instead of timelessness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrrsd38hrg3frka3gmkjm3))
- We’re trapped in a Never-Ending Now — blind to history, engulfed in the present moment, overwhelmed by the slightest breeze of chaos. Here’s the bottom line: You should prioritize the accumulated wisdom of humanity over what’s trending on Twitter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrs25b34nbv4e5a0dxm9vd))
- **Short-form**: Social media is at its best when it matches you with people who share your exact interests and teach you about what you want to write about. Unfollow celebrities. Replace them with people who make you smarter and bring long-lasting joy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrv9thqg5pz3jtvnq2yh0g))
- **Medium-form**: Read less of the news. Subscribe to magazines and YouTube channels that post timeless ideas. Read essays and speeches that have stood the test of time. Find people whose recommendations you consistently enjoy and subscribe to their newsletters. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrvg789qgcxg92kxmtrrxp))
- **Long-form**: Get away from your screen and read more books. If it helps, start a book club. Find classic books to read. Watch old documentaries and listen to lecture series. Crawl the Internet for college syllabuses so you can read them on your own time.1 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrvj5rf9yp1faw86ksf5zd))
- Now that your incoming information is solid, you need a way to harness it. It’s not enough just to binge eBooks and list a stat on your website (one Write of Passage student refers to this as [“Book](https://www.camiloms.com/musings/book-chugging) [Chugging](https://www.camiloms.com/musings/book-chugging).”) You should save the best parts of what you read, so you can easily reference them later. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrw0hg17wk62vv00fhvpzf))
- Notes are so central to my writing process that writing without them is like building a campfire without a pile of wood. Because I’m so diligent about writing ideas down, I don’t need to run back to the “forest” every time I get stuck. Instead of starting a new research process for each new article, I pull from ideas I’ve already captured in my casual reading, in conversations, and in the ordinary moments of my life. All those notes became intellectual fodder for future pieces. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrw4kp2wg4gsvh806w0z4e))
- I call this process “**Ambient Research**.” By the time I sit down to write about a topic, I’ve already done most of the research I need to write about it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrwjpj6662ska01qg2gkkg))
- This method of Ambient Research is the opposite of what I learned in school. My teachers promoted Active Research, which led me to spend hours reading in the library after I picked a topic. Without notes to build upon, I had to start from scratch whenever I began an essay. Since I’m a slow reader, I had to give up my weekends for research. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrwsgamxgfj0c87kyadvdh))
- ![](https://i0.wp.com/perell.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/PNG-image-3.png?w=844&ssl=1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbryce76pbd930n2pcbthsn))
- Effective ambient research happens when you capture the best ideas you consume, the epiphanies you have, and the things you’ve already written to friends and colleagues. I’ll focus on each in the next three sections. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbryp5g2cmbzgqg4hy38pac))
- I never read articles in my web browser. When I come across an interesting article, I save it to an app that automatically downloads it to my phone so I can read it later. Saving these articles gets me out of a reactivity loop, where I read things immediately after I find them (which is what most people do). I want my reading to be much more intentional than that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbrz1g6r68km5pgkrtk5dnv))
- Read-it-Later apps act as a quality filter for your reading too. By saving articles to an app and refusing to instantly read things you come across on the Internet, you raise the bar for what grabs your attention. With a Read-it-Later app, whenever you sit down to read, you have hundreds of articles to choose from. You can allocate your attention to the best one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbs0eyb03qd9zp1y2cy8tkb))
- Many of your unique and provocative ideas will come when you’re away from the computer — doing chores, driving around, or walking through your neighborhood. Ideas are fickle. That’s why so many of history’s greatest writers have walked around with a notepad. When I read about the writing processes of historians, they repeatedly talk about how they capture their impressions *immediately* after an interview ends, while their memories are still sharp. They know that ideas that seem obvious in the moment will be forgotten by the time they’re ready to write about them. Following their lead, whenever I have an important idea, I assume I won’t remember it and write it down as soon as possible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbs1sapxhxev1r3sy7hyvwz))
- Note-taking is the closest thing we have to time travel. It’s rebellion against the entropy of memory. Kendrick Lamar insists that much of the “writing” for his lyrics happens in the note-taking process. In one interview, he [said](https://www.gq.com/video/watch/watch-kendrick-lamar-meet-rick-rubin-and-have-an-epic-conversation): “I have to write them down and then five or three months later, I have to find that same emotion that I felt when I was inspired by it, so I have to dig deep to see what triggered the idea… It comes back because I have key little words that make me realize the exact emotion which drew the inspiration.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbs2chr2fwtvvy01qkk2byf))
- Your ability to transcribe an event is better than your ability to remember it. Writing down your observations makes you more observant, and once you commit to capturing them, your brain generates more of them. It’s like photography. Putting a camera in your hands turns every moment into a photo opportunity, which makes you more aware of your surroundings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbs2r3w7tkwh379fk4kv7qf))
- Likewise, I often find that I’ve written parts of my piece without realizing it, either in emails to friends or Slack messages to colleagues. Sometimes, I’ll even search my tweet history. I’ve made a habit out of saving anything substantial I write to a central note-taking system so I can easily retrieve it in the future. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbs9fas6q986e0s9x10qqm3))
- The brain is great at creating connections, but terrible at remembering specific details (which is what computers are uniquely good at). Note-taking works best when the ideas are saved in a central location that contains the best reading and [thinking](https://perell.com/essay/how-philosophers-think/) you’ve ever done. The easier it is to search those notes, the faster you’ll be able to find them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsb1ycjcntwt84nwz8pezg))
- Though note-taking has been transformative for many writers, it’s telling that none of the best writers I know have a perfect note-taking system. They make something that works (even if it’s duct-taped together), and get on with what’s important: actually writing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsbh2hqaepj9b27j67jx4p))
- **he point of taking notes is to write, not to have the perfect note-taking system.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsce9hhyd85fwv510d8hd1))
## New highlights added November 10, 2024 at 10:54 PM
- Study the writing practices of history’s top writers and you may be surprised by how many kept a [commonplace book](https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/). A commonplace book is a central place where you can save ideas, quotes, epiphanies, photos, drawings, and whatever else you want to remember. Marcus Aurelius, the former emperor of Rome, used his commonplace book to write *Meditations;* Montaigne, who basically invented the essay format, kept one; so did Napoleon, HL Mencken, and Thomas Jefferson. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsdknf93p6qwgq4fye5ett))
- Since most of your ideas will arise when you’re away from the computer, capturing ideas should be frictionless. You should be able to write an idea down within 10 seconds of having it. If writing a note takes too long, you won’t write the good ones down, and eventually, you’ll forget your best ones. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbse2a0vrjqypcz5b2m107c))
- You should be able to instantly capture ideas while reading too. There are several ways to do this, but Readwise provides the most elegant solution. Everytime you highlight in Kindle or on Instapaper, and everytime you bookmark a tweet, it shoots that information into a central repository where it’ll live until the messiah returns or the heat death of the universe. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbse6xecw43eyj7ggxh8j22))
- If the search function on your note-taking app is powerful, you don’t need to spend much time organizing ideas. You can throw a bunch of quotes and hunches and statistics and graphs and photos and rants into a single location, knowing that you’ll be able to find them later. Over time, you’ll develop a personal Google search engine. But unlike the actual Google, you’ll have pre-vetted everything inside of it and you’ll serendipitously stumble upon ideas you forgot you’d ever seen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsew5x95vvtqrefht358w1))
- I start my essays in split-screen mode. On the left side of the screen, I have my notes. On the right, my blank document. To fill up the blank page and give myself momentum, I’ll run a few searches through my note-taking system, and copy & paste the best stuff onto my new essay document. As I add ideas to the document, patterns emerge which become the structure of the piece. Usually, the piece’s structure organically emerges, as if I’m being guided by an invisible muse. What was recently just a bunch of messy ideas in my note-taking system turns into a structured outline. All I need to do is fill in the gaps, add transitions between ideas, and rewrite the prose until it reflects my best thinking on the subject. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsjkabq1p63n3f83wst2hf))
- It’s worth spending some up-front time to build a note-taking system. But remember, it doesn’t need to be fancy. Mine is a mess. Once you have an easy system for adding and searching ideas in a single location, it’s time to write. Gone goes the blank white page of doom. Now, when you sit down to write, you’ll instantly be able to draw from the best ideas you’ve ever had. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsk4kgz39smnxr4595j4g5))
- You don’t need to do it alone. In fact, being in conversation will make you a better writer. Humans are not fully autonomous thinkers; we are social beings. Conversations let us identify high-potential ideas and tweak their delivery until they represent our best thinking on a subject. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbskqc2tmvsj7fr3tcr9spd))
- My ideas took on a new level of refinement once I started **Writing from Conversation**. 
  The concept may be new, but the method is centuries old. [The Bible](https://perell.com/essay/why-youre-christian/) was spoken long before it was ever written. So were most Greek tragedies. More recently, Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of the top writers of the 19th century, developed his famous essays through public lectures. When lectures like *The American Scholar* resonated with the audience, he published them in writing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsky1ve5hay9gd4tr878sp))
- In so many areas, from design, to startups, to relationships — **improvement comes from feedback**. When you’re so close to an idea, you’re victim to your own blindspots. Instead of assuming what’s good, conversations prove it. Before you sit down to write, you can test your ideas in conversation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsm6mkz2ntq6f3wpqza0q2))
- Many writers suffer from perfectionism, where they refuse to share ideas until they’re perfect. Perfectionism is particularly pernicious because it’s a vice that looks like a virtue. It’s the child of two parents: fear and narcissism. It’s dangerous because you can rationalize away your fears with the excuse that your standards are higher than everybody else’s. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsn1aa2vsdchdt2544f15j))
- To shake the temptations of perfectionism, I share half-baked ideas all the time. Doing so helps my writing because I can run ideas through numerous filters, such as blogs, tweets, and email newsletters. By the time I’ve published an essay like this one, I’ve run the ideas through various forms of low-cost, high-speed trial-and-error. Each time I receive feedback, I keep more of what resonates and less of what doesn’t. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsndg1asesgmndeqxm2tfg))
- The Content Triangle is embedded into the world of comedy too. I once lived with a comic who basically tested his stand-up routine on me every night. Turns out, he wasn’t the only one. Comedians are always testing jokes with friends and small audiences before they film their Netflix special. Chris Rock once [said](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/hard/): “When I start a tour, it’s not like I start out in arenas. Before this last tour, I performed in this place in New Brunswick called the Stress Factory. I did about 40 or 50 shows getting ready for the tour.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsnxbahwc8v27fnj18tjtj))
- You’re having routine conversations all the time. Don’t discount the feedback you receive from them. Test your ideas out on intelligent friends. If an idea consistently surprises somebody, it’s probably good, but if people look bored or confused when you’re sharing an idea, you should either drop it or communicate the idea differently. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbspwb95serd64c09jwj0mc))
- The Content Triangle is a method for developing ideas in various stages:
  1. Conversations with **friends** help us discover surprising ideas that are worth exploring.
  2. Conversations with **readers** tell us if an idea will resonate with our audience.
  3. Conversations with **editors** help us improve how our ideas are delivered.
  ![](https://i0.wp.com/perell.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/CleanShot-2022-09-20-at-09.01.41%402x.png?w=1772&ssl=1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsq27cka8k88w7p0wy61cr))
- Speaking is the first draft of thought. I often struggle to structure ideas when I’m writing about them. But once I start to speak, words have a way of coming together. Saying something out-loud gives me an initial structure that I can refine in subsequent drafts. When I feel an idea emerging in my head, I often pull a voice-to-text transcription app to record my thoughts (I recommend [Otter](https://otter.ai/)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsr1t8a88hwg8pxpxr76jk))
- Speaking is good for generating ideas, and writing is how you perfect them. When you write in a text editor, you have the ability to pause, edit, and dwell on a sentence. Often you can get stuck on perfecting your introduction for an hour before you even get into the meat of your idea. Speaking out loud doesn’t let you stop. You can only move forward. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsw67fdra85rtth7hqj4m0))
- The power of speech is amplified through conversation. In conversation, your partner’s reactions can help you gauge the quality of what you’re saying. Sparring partners take you to the heart of an idea. They force us to distill ideas to their essence. We change our delivery based on who we’re speaking with too. Your ideas will be funnier if you’re yapping at the bar with your college buddies. If you’re at a crowded boardroom roundtable, you’re more likely to give a compressed elevator style pitch than a full lecture. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbswj4ckna3f97y3gkt4tcj))
- When you start exploring an idea, it sprawls all over the place. Like a college smoke session, you’re in the “dude, if you really think about it, everything is connected” phase. In truth, most of the ideas are fluff (like somebody who tells 15 minutes of backstory before the good stuff begins). Even if there’s a “woah” moment at the end, the boring backstory puts you to sleep before the punchline. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsxp6a2ke973qzqe4zd4pf))
- Skip the 12-minute rant. Test facets of your ideas (briefly) and observe the reactions. Conversations aren’t the place to explore every nuance, counterpoint, backstory, and implication of your idea. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsy0bcwzsyezjt7tnv1x3t))
- Embrace the dance of conversation. Good conversations push the frontier of consciousness. Pick one small part of your idea and put it out there. Observe. Watch their body language as you speak. Notice the questions they ask and the assumptions they bring to the table. All those responses yield new information. You see the map of your idea through their eyes, which shapes your next move. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsyehyzata4qspfk7hcaan))
- You can identify each emotion in conversation, based on people’s facial expressions: they raise their eyebrows when they’re confused, invite you to speed up when you’re repeating yourself, lean in when they’re interested, look away when they’re bored, and open their eyes when they’re surprised. If you can pay attention to how people respond in casual conversation, you can develop ideas before you put them on paper, which makes the writing process more efficient, effective, and enjoyable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbsz1s62ttmr4c44cft05sq))
- If their eyes widen, they let out a gasp, and go “whoa!”— jackpot. You’ve surprised them. You’ve found something worth building your essay around. Remember what you said and remember to write down exactly how you said it (if you’re fired up, sneaking off to the bathroom is the most socially acceptable way to take notes in the heat of conversation). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbszfk01th4x829vk7av6tj))
- **Surprise signals that someone’s mental model of the world has changed** (AKA, you’ve blown their mind). It’s more than just [learning](https://perell.com/essay/against-3x-speed/) a new fact. It’s the kind of epiphany that comes deep from left field and breaks your expectations. Sometimes we grow so familiar with ideas that we stop recognizing the surprise in them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbt08725wdapr7ff6kd4w4m))
- Optimizing for surprise means cutting out the filler and doubling-down on the parts of your idea that defy expectations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbt0dftmj3frgd7a0z7zjfg))
- A serious advantage of writing from conversation is that you avoid “Writer Brain.” When you open a Google Doc (hint, doc.new), it’s easy to boot up the tedious writing patterns you picked up in school. You tense up. “Time to get serious,” you say. You become a risk averse, politically correct dweeb— and more status obsessed than Regina George in *Mean Girls*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbt12g7mrx3fbtr6nn65gqp))
- The rising costs of WrongThink leads to self-censorship when it’s time to write. For fear of cancellation, we lock away unpopular opinions. Gone go the flames of passion and the snarky one-liners. Writer Brain inevitably takes over, becoming a cock block that keeps our personality away from our ideas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbt1zgfv7nzw07aqhkkrsg2))
- “Friend Brain” is our natural way of speaking. It comes easily to us in conversation, and it knows how to party. It’s the friend your Mom warned you about — the one who was super mischievous and high-agency and gave you that intrepid spirit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbt27x33b5gj4teq673g2nq))
- Conversations with trusted friends awaken your primal nature. They’re arson for your scared and timid self — the weakling inside of you that cares too much about what other people think. Only with trusted friends can you speak with an unfiltered and passionate fury. Cry. Scream. Rile yourself up. Rant like a Jewish grandmother. And if you really need to, get whiskey drunk and see what spills out after drink #3. In these moments of sweltering honesty, once we’ve freed ourselves from a self-induced prison of the mind, we’re able to unleash brave and surprising ideas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbt2ygq4v7xj19qsa8wmv0g))
- Once an idea resonates in conversations with friends, it’s time to test it with your readers online. Before the Internet, your testing was limited to in-person social interactions. Never has it been so easy to be in constant conversation with people around the world who can respond directly to your ideas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbt8dz39xg5zwfja2hycxjg))
- It can help to think of your writing like a tech company thinks about their product. Great products are spurred by tons of feedback. The same is true for writing. Conversations with readers make your ideas crisp and free you from the curse of knowledge. *The Amateur’s Mind* is one of the best books written about playing better chess. The author, Jeremy Silman, an International Master, spent a bunch of time speaking to amateur chess players about their challenges. Patterns emerged. Those conversations with readers helped him understand his readers and know what to write about.4 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbt8y4kzsne2j470pqesp17))
- Twitter and email are good places to share half-baked (but still edited) thoughts.5 Asking questions to your audience can work too. Done right, the feedback you receive can lead to interesting ideas you wouldn’t have found otherwise. If a response surprises you, it’ll probably surprise your readers too. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbt9aggth384j953g1pn596))
- The sooner you receive feedback, the better. Conversations with readers are the way to determine which ideas are worth sculpting into full-fledged essays. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbt9fr93pmmk3xc0rb1nf3w))
- I’ve never seen a non-fiction book pierce the winds of culture like James Clear’s *Atomic Habits.* He followed a feedback-driven writing process. He used Twitter to test his ideas. The engagement (or lack thereof) he received showed him when to double-down on an idea. Reader questions helped him find the best ways to articulate a concept. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbta4fk0csppv9kbmy5mbwh))
- His success points to a new paradigm in the way writers shape ideas. In the past, authors have developed their writing in private, only to share their *magnum opus* once it’s complete. Online writers are different. They share ideas with readers along the way. This dialogue has the twin benefit of helping authors refine their ideas while they build their audience. As I write this, *Atomic Habits* is the most popular non-fiction book on Amazon. In 2021, it was likely the best-selling book in the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbtaesrmk6fjfkv70tsaq3n))
- Feedback-driven books are simply… better. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbtaw5jnhhqqrrn0afq8v7c))
- Until you develop a form of low-grade telepathy, your best bet is to cultivate feedback. By doing so, your writing will have less fat and a hell of a lot more meat on the bone. By the time you publish your book (or a long-form essay like this one), you’ll have gone through multiple cycles of the Content Triangle until each section has Idea-Market-Fit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbtb77j79v4j2yv2j5b0q4z))
- Though I recommend data-driven writing, it’s just a tool. Your intuition can be just as important as metrics from the market. Though Twitter is a good place to test the popularity of an idea, it doesn’t exactly encourage thoughtful responses — which are more likely to arise via an email newsletter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbtbj01k9gpqzk8k1dbx9vq))
- Many of my best essays have started by sharing embryo ideas in my newsletters and engaging in conversations with readers. I read every reply. Those replies highlight which ideas have legs and are worth pursuing. Sometimes, the responses catapult my writing on a new trajectory.

- In one Monday Musings edition, I wrote about the commitment crisis. Time horizons are shortening and young careerists prefer optionality over commitment.

- Once you’ve developed ideas with a crowd, it’s time to bring them to a small group of fellow craftsmen. You don’t need to pay a professional editor.

- But if you’re doing serious writing, it’s worth working with a human editor. Depending on what you’re struggling with, you can ask them for different kinds of feedback. Early in a piece, when you’re vomiting ideas onto the page, editors can help you identify what to focus on. They can also tell you if the piece is out of balance, like when you have a swarm of interesting observations but no personal stories to bring them to life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbtfgw97243sdesjybjqweg))
- In later phases, when the piece is coming together, it helps to get reactions from your editor. As they read, they can highlight sentences from your draft and share their feelings with you. 
  In [Write of](https://writeofpassage.school/) [Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/), we use an acronym called CRIBS. Editors mark if a section is confusing, repetitive, interesting, surprising or boring. The method is universal because it focuses on standard emotions that everybody has instead of the mechanics of writing, which fewer people are familiar with. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbtghy0eh98v7q28zrqqdqg))
- **Confusing:** The more friction in the communication process, the harder it’ll be for an idea to get from the writer’s mind into the reader’s. Most of the time, when the reader is confused about what I’m trying to say, so is the writer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbtha3tz4e704ks36pqswpp))
- **Repeated:** Good writing is compressed. By definition, if you’re repeating yourself, your writing isn’t as tight as it could be. Compressed writing doesn’t mean short (just look at the length of this guide!). It just means that the pacing is brisk and each word serves a unique purpose. If people on the Internet always wanted the shortest thing they could find, Joe Rogan wouldn’t have the most popular podcast in the world.

- **Surprising:** This is the holy grail of quality writing because surprising ideas challenge the reader’s worldview. It is the writer’s equivalent of a laugh. It’s the metric we use to determine if our writing is engaging. It comforts the confused and confuses the comforted. Ideas that are novel but not surprising are the definition of trivia (which sounds a lot like trivial for a reason). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbtrc9sbcmnw9f28abxagjr))

- In school, the longer we work on an essay, the longer it gets. We’re trained to write bloated thesis papers to satisfy the teacher’s word counts (and if you’re anything like me, you also increased the spacing between every line so you didn’t have to write as much). But online writing is the opposite. Fluff is punished and [compression](https://perell.com/essay/expression-is-compression/) is rewarded.

- Early ideas become final drafts in the same way that tree sap becomes maple syrup. What begins as a bunch of raw material gets distilled into sweetness. Just as it takes 50 gallons of sap to make one gallon of maple syrup, writing is always a process of distillation. Good writers distill hours (or weeks) of experience into a short, compressed artifact. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbttawh8q0x3c2jcm78a4m3))
- The means may have evolved, but the core methods are similar. More recently, Arnold Schwarzenegger became the world’s biggest movie star because unlike the other actors of his time, he saw acting as only part of his job. As he writes in his biography: “Too many actors, writers, and artists think that marketing is beneath them. But no matter what you do in life, selling is part of it.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbtw7k7hhddgmvwqhzs6xv6))
- His work was only halfway done once the filming for a movie was over. No matter how good it was, it wouldn’t spread without great marketing. Arnold looked down upon other actors who relied on agents and managers to do the marketing for them. By outsourcing promotion, they didn’t just lose a cut of the cash they deserved. They also lost control over how the movie was framed and the narrative of their own career. Little surprise that today, Arnold writes the best email newsletter of any celebrity I know.

- No matter how good your work is, building an audience will take time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbtx5j3djpmy77td2te7a2n))
- It’s a slow process, but don’t let that fact turn you off. That’s what makes having an audience so powerful. An audience is valuable because it takes time to build. If it happened quickly, it wouldn’t be a sustainable advantage. You can buy attention, but you can’t buy trust. It has to be earned, and that’s what makes it so precious. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbtx8ckmceg32whf1eft20d))
- Just because you have attention, doesn’t mean you have an audience. An audience isn’t the number of people who know your name. It’s the number of people you can contact at any time (which is why traditional celebrities don’t have audiences even though they’re famous). Some audiences are far better than others too. Large followings don’t necessarily lead to loyalty, like the Instagram bikini model with 2 million followers who couldn’t sell 36 T-Shirts. And then there are writers like Byrne Hobart whose work is read by some of the world’s smartest people, and Jack Butcher who earns freakish amounts of cash per subscriber. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbtxsp6ez034qn8ebhwejhf))
- Building an audience begins with attracting people on public platforms like Twitter and Reddit, both of which act like public squares where you can reach people at scale, for free. These public platforms are governed by algorithms that match people with similar interests. Since the biggest ones have hundreds of millions of people, they are divided into tiny subcultures, most of which are too niche to function in the physical world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbv6nmkzc66qxgm2k9d754j))
- Even if public platforms are the top of your marketing funnel, they come with a tradeoff. What they give you in free reach, they take away in the lack of a connection to your audience. Their terms and conditions agreements state that they have a right to kick you off the platform. Since they own your data, you can’t download your follower graph and transport it to another network.

- I like Naval Ravikant’s line on this: “Building an audience on a public platform is like building a castle out of sand.” One second, you have a fancy following to show your friends.

- Do what James Clear did. He grew his audience on the back of Google, Instagram, and Twitter. Though search engines and social media platforms are fickle, Clear converted ~2 million readers into email subscribers who he can now contact directly at any time. Unlike Twitter and Instagram, Clear’s email list isn’t mediated by an algorithm. He can save and download all the emails he’s gathered at any time. He built his audience by initially standing on the shoulders of a public platform and transferring those relationships to a private one.

- You can’t launch a random, no-name blog and expect people to magically find it. Start by identifying the places on the Internet where your readers like to hang out. You can go in two directions:
  1. **Big Social Networks:** Places like Twitter and Reddit where millions of people can learn about an industry or subscribe to specific sub-communities. Think of these like massive public squares.
  2. **Small Forums:** If massive networks aren’t for you, look for intimate public spaces where like-minded people gather. Maybe it’s an industry-specific forum. Maybe it’s a Slack channel focused around a specific theme. Though small forums are less likely to give you scale and reach, they’re a good way to find people who share your interests.

- Resist the temptation to build an audience on multiple platforms at once. I once had a conversation with an aspiring online writer. We’ll call him Mike. He’d been writing online for five years, but struggled to build a meaningful audience. When I asked him about his distribution strategy, he told me he’s re-purposing his content for all the major social media platforms: Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and even the new up-and-coming ones that everybody knows won’t live up to the hype. All that work paralyzed him. He was so scattered that he didn’t allow himself to commit to a single platform. From Mike, I learned that even if it’s okay to experiment with different platforms in the early days, you should quickly go all-in on one of them.

- The Internet is a game of power laws. One of the biggest myths in marketing is that you need multiple marketing channels to succeed.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbvazfx3c72pg3mp7km596c))
- Reaching people on public platforms starts with adapting your ideas to the network you’re using. Don’t send people to another platform. Reach them where they already are instead. Each one has a different culture. Twitter is focused on ideas, IndieHackers is focused on mid-length forum posts, and Medium is focused on long-form essays. Like any club, participants reward those who make the platform a better place. They intuitively reward good actors and punish the bad ones — fraudsters, hucksters, and link spammers.

- Consider the [difference](https://newsletterest.com/message/96492/321-Canvas-Ad-The-Kyiv-Independent-Copywriting-Tips) in strategies between two Ukrainian newspapers: *The Kyiv Post* and *The Kyiv Independent.* Every public platform wants to keep people on it because they can’t show people ads once they leave. Thus, the algorithm downranks posts that take people off-platform. Though both newspapers were covering the same war, *The Kyiv Independent* was much more successful because they condensed stories into multi-part Twitter threads instead of sharing article links. Twitter threads led to engagement, engagement led to virality, and virality led to *The Kyiv Independent’s* rapid follower growth.

- Link people to your newsletter or an article that expands on what you’ve written. On Twitter, people will link to their website in their bio and their newsletter at the end of a thread (I’ve picked up at least 30,000 email subscribers by writing threads and linking to my email list in the last tweet).

- Newsletter platforms shine with simplicity, but fall short on their personal touch. The lack of customization features makes it hard to show off your personality. Substack isn’t built for people who want to dial in their aesthetic, sell products, or hyper-customize their site. Instead, it’s engineered for people who want to monetize their writing directly, via subscriptions, and it does that very well.

- The difference between Substack and a website is like the difference between a mall kiosk and a retail store. Sure, you can sell clothes from a kiosk. You have low overhead and a bunch of walk-by foot traffic too. The problem with a kiosk is that each one looks undifferentiated to the casual observer.

  2. **Aesthetics**: The ability to express your personality through visuals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbvjpke71nyk93wr88v1khd))
- Newsletter platforms don’t guide readers towards the ideas they care about. They have a recency bias, and care more about email delivery than a coherent archive of your work. Since the archive is sorted chronologically, it prioritizes things that we published recently, and so the best stuff is often buried. If you’re writing timeless, “evergreen” articles, you seriously want to consider a website. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcbvnfay3nywkn0gjn543cqr))

- Most essay pages are terribly organized. Instead of featuring the writer’s best pieces, they overwhelm the reader with a bunch of essays listed in chronological order.

- Using Substack as a de facto online home has worked for many creators like Packy McCormick, a Write of Passage alum. He built a giant audience with more than 100,000 newsletter subscribers by publishing straight to Substack. It’s easier to publish there because you don’t have to worry about designing your site, paying for a subscription, or linking an email capture form to your site.

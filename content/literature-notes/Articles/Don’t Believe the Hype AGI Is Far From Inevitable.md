## Highlights
- Creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) with human-level cognition is ‘impossible’, explains Iris van Rooij, lead author of the paper and professor of Computational Cognitive Science, who heads the Cognitive Science and AI department at Radboud University. ‘Some argue that AGI is possible in principle, that it’s only a matter of time before we have computers that can think like humans think. But principle isn’t enough to make it actually doable. Our paper explains why chasing this goal is a fool’s errand, and a waste of humanity’s resources.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcpc33z8xvjypyy6e1nbnt3g))

## Highlights
- we should be focused on building products for ourselves first. v1 is for us. Others will find alternative uses for products we build, just as they have with Basecamp. And we may suggest alternative uses to expand people's imaginations, and the market for the products. But every feature in v1 of Basecamp existed because we needed it. Nothing was imagined for anyone else. Over the years we've of course made changes to products to adapt to the needs of customers, while not straying too far from home. That's good. But v1 is sacred to us.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb04f5rxcxkt7caczdwpr7jc))
- And that’s the key, really. v1 is for us. No one else. Others will use it, many will resonate with it, but ultimately, v1 is ours. It’s sacred ground. There’s an eternity to change, tweak, modify, grow, expand, and adjust for everyone else, but there’s only a fixed amount of time to make that perfect version 1 for us. To tie the knot on the reason we made the thing on the first place: Because *we* needed it, because *we* wanted it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb04fap4g1ab9bfp17z6swsx))
    - Note: Hi
- We don’t do MVPs here. I don’t believe in MVPs. I think they’re the lowest of the lowest bar, an insult to product development in general. What’s less inspiring than something that’s Minimally Viable? We do what I call MPV1s. Maximally Proud Version 1s. Version 1 won’t be everything to everyone, but it’ll be everything to us. Just what we need, and nothing more. And we’ll be proud of every part of it — and also what it isn’t, yet. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb04fzdvccf5pymv9afnvm2m))

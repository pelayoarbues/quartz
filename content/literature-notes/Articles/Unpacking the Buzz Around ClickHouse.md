## Highlights
- My two previous posts, 15 Years of Realtime OLAP ([part 1](https://materializedview.io/p/15-years-of-realtime-olap-part-1), [part 2](https://materializedview.io/p/15-years-of-realtime-olap-part-2)), documented my experience with home-grown realtime OLAP systems, [Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org/), and Apache Pinot.

- ClickHouse is indeed very fast. A friend told me, “They have the mentality of a team on a budget. Like they didn’t have 1000s of machines to throw at the problem. They had to make it work on what they had.” This might or might not be true—ClickHouse [comes from Yandex](https://clickhouse.com/blog/introducing-click-house-inc)—but the software definitely has this vibe.

## Highlights
- UK telecom company Virgin Media O2 just revealed a fascinating AI entity: an audio chatbot that takes the persona of a confused grandmother, fine-tuned to do nothing except make phone scammers angry. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy1y6v5phk66ecnk1j4jvy3))
- "As 'Head of Scammer Relations,' this state-of-the-art AI Granny's mission is to talk with fraudsters and waste as much of their time as possible with human-like rambling," Virgin Media wrote [of the bot](https://news.virginmediao2.co.uk/o2-unveils-daisy-the-ai-granny-wasting-scammers-time/).

- "By tricking the criminals into thinking they were defrauding a real person and playing on scammers' biases about older people, Daisy has prevented them from targeting real victims," read the Virgin blog. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy1yvfpeb4bdp6ecbwhdmw2))
- "But crucially, Daisy is also a reminder that no matter how persuasive someone on the other end of the phone may be, they aren't always who you think they are," Virgin fraud director Murray Mackenzie added. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcy1z2g176t7gpfj4bgkgzgk))

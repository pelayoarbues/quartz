## Highlights
- The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in education is transforming classrooms globally, and the Republic of Korea is at the forefront of this revolution. [As one of the world's most technologically advanced nations, Korea is leveraging AI to enhance educational quality, creating a new classroom dynamic that is both teacher-led and AI-enabled.](https://twitter.com/) This transformation is not only about improving learning outcomes but also addressing urgent challenges such as hyper-competition in education, a shrinking student population, and evolving demands on the teaching profession. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbz5a8hrzkjjnnmqw5wh8krk))
- Korea's commitment to education has long been a cornerstone of its economic success, leading to universal higher education and consistently high student performance in international assessments like the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbz5asm8k75qpjcc6nhfr4kq))
- Despite these impressive achievements, the country faces several persistent challenges. Students in Korea face intense competition for college entrance, while also facing a job market that demands new skills, particularly in AI and digital literacy. With a declining student population, the current education model is becoming less sustainable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbz5ayns3b4zm6n6kv4a0vnh))
- To address these challenges, the Korean government has embraced a bold digital transformation strategy, with AI at its core. This strategy gained significant momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated the adoption of online learning tools and underscored the need for more flexible, personalized education.

- In February 2023, the Ministry of Education unveiled an ambitious plan to integrate AI deeply into the public education system. A key component of this plan is the development of digital textbooks that leverage AI to personalize learning experiences for each student. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbz5bcrbhah0nt3wna8be25q))
- At the heart of Korea's AI education strategy lies the creation of AI digital textbooks. These advanced tools mark a significant departure from traditional textbooks in several ways:
  • **AI-based courseware integration**: AI supports the delivery of personalized learning experiences.
  • **Real-time data collection**: These textbooks gather and analyze student performance data in real time, allowing for continuous feedback.
  • **Adaptive learning**: The system customizes content to meet the individual needs of each student, adjusting the pace and difficulty of the material.
  • **Teacher support**: AI digital textbooks help teachers tailor their instruction based on detailed insights into student performance, fostering more effective, targeted teaching. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbz5chtkrcfaf20esq1vy6r7))
- The rollout of AI digital textbooks begins in March 2025 for grades 3, 4, 7, and 10, covering subjects like English, math, information, and Korean for special education. The plan is to expand this rollout to additional subjects, including social studies and science with full implementation across all schools by 2028. Korea will become the first nation in the world to introduce AI digital textbooks nationwide, signaling a major shift towards digital-based education. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbz5dke3fscqr0xzw00ccd5a))
- However, the introduction of AI digital textbooks is not the end goal but rather a catalyst for a broader transformation of the classroom. This change is teacher-led, with educators taking on new roles in this AI-enhanced environment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbz5dtbaacky6q3ghg1h5hy7))
- In this new model, teachers become facilitators by shifting from transmitting knowledge to facilitating learning through projects, problem-solving, and collaboration. Teachers will also focus more on mentoring, coaching, and fostering critical thinking skills, leaving routine tasks to AI-driven tools. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbz5dz1q55xxrqrtfmr4wsft))
- This redefined role ensures that the classroom remains a human-centered environment where AI enhances, rather than replaces, the essential work of teaching. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbz5e61wny07k8vznaazpks7))
- Recognizing that AI's successful integration hinges on teacher preparation, Korea has launched several large-scale initiatives aimed at empowering educators. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbz5eb897529xktb7g3sercr))
- This framework equips teachers with the skills needed for AI-enabled, human-centered teaching through training and professional learning communities. By 2026, Korea aims to train all teachers in the effective use of digital technology for classroom innovation. Through these learning communities, teachers will also be able to share best practices and strategies for safely integrating AI into their classrooms. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbz5edmb8905e8s0z1q12w04))
- The Korean government has allocated approximately $0.74 billion for three years (2024–2026) specifically for teacher training as part of its broader AI-enabled education investment. This effort ensures that teachers are not only prepared to adopt new tools but are also empowered to lead the design and implementation of innovative teaching models that leverage AI to enhance student learning.

- The [Improvement Plan for Digital Infrastructure in Primary and Secondary Education](https://www.moe.go.kr/boardCnts/viewRenew.do?boardID=294&lev=0&statusYN=W&s=moe&m=020402&opType=N&boardSeq=98896) includes the following to create an optimal environment for AI digital textbooks:
  • **Distribution and management of devices**: All schools will be equipped with the necessary devices (one device per student) along with comprehensive usage guidelines.
  • **Network Environment:** School networks nationwide will be upgraded for AI digital textbooks, with an integrated management system.
  • **Support Personnel:** Digital tutors will assist with AI digital textbook classes and device management, and tech centers will be set up in each education office**.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbz5f91cxtenyf1qtg2hktfa))
- The Ministry of Education, in collaboration with Metropolitan Education Offices, has been designing a comprehensive evaluation and monitoring framework. This involves:
  • **Pilot testing**: AI courseware, AI digital textbook prototypes, and new teaching practices are trialed in select schools before the full introduction of AI digital textbooks.
  • **Data collection and analysis**: Student performance data is gathered and analyzed to assess the effectiveness of AI tools.
  • **Impact evaluation**: Rigorous methods will be used to measure the impact of AI integration on learning outcomes, teacher efficacy, and classroom dynamics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbz5g7hg7y2rfpjac8eqsyve))

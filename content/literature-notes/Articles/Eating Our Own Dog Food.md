## Highlights
- In 1988 an **email titled “Eating our own Dogfood”** was sent by Paul Maritz, manager at **Microsoft** to his colleague Brian Valentine.
  Valentine’s was a test manager and as people may guess, the email was encouraging **the internal use of their own product.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5ebpff7krak84pdshfh020))
- Since then the term is used more widely in jest by tech companies creating new products that in many cases solve problems they face themselves, **to promote testing and validating what they are building.**
  Although it may sound obvious to test something you’re building by using it yourself, the **philosophy ranges wider than testing your end-product**, and can be the difference between good and great products. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5ec0ya3vkg0vcm20zafkse))
- **The obvious lessons of “eating your own dogfood” or using your own product are still valuable and worth mentioning.**
  Whether a tool or product is intended to be consumer facing, for other businesses or to be used internally, using them as an engineer/product owner/designer are **valuable for bug testing and exploring the user experience.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5ec9fntwchxmafj5mk45ta))
- When testing your own product it is normal to be blind to obvious drawbacks by being **naturally familiarised with the system** you are working on . It is still a good initial step before more rigorous testing with people not accustomed to what you are building.
  When I worked in a 5-person team launching a consumer hardware product with an accompanying app, we would test our application by **running it with each of our phones.**
  These simple tests let us efficiently test if new features would **work across different smartphone operating systems and phone models.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5ecra30p4hz1y0dphbs8mm))
- For more in-depth testing we would use our product in ways that **were less contained** and would let us **experience our application breaking**. While our application was running we would test by:
  • **Running other apps** in the background
  • **Quitting the app** on our phones
  • **Turning off Bluetooth** on our phones
  Although these tests would verify that our technology worked with more obscure scenarios, - “eating our own dogfood” also included testing our application for its **intended use** (which in our case was for assisted mindfulness activities).

- **To act as your user is not always to act as your customer, as your customer is only one user.**
  If you are building a consumer product, your end product is **not the only product or system you can test.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5ed4zsj63kj01w16k9hxq9))
- Will Shu, the founder of Deliveroo (UK food delivery app) has said **[that he still carries out deliveries to test the companies app.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=-Mk8Yq6ptxI)**
  Despite Deliveroo being a consumer facing product, he is testing the **user experience for people working for Deliveroo** who use the app for carrying out deliveries. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5eddya33tspngngdzczp9c))
- Shu mentions how as well as testing the app’s functionality and reliability, he arrives at restaurants to pick the food up, and **occasionally experiences restaurant staff being rude to him.**
  Although carrying out deliveries helps Shu test the technology the team use on a daily basis, he is also given a **unique insight to the day-to-day experiences they face.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5ednyr3smfkh3hm4nwcn6x))
- **In scenarios where it is not possible to directly test what you are building it is important to get as strong of an insight as possible.**
  When working at Siemens Magnet Technology as a Process Engineering Intern, all of my projects were aimed at making the manufacturing process **safer or leaner.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5edxbk91afjb9hhszqjcs5))
- As Adam Grant writes in his book “Give and Take”, good long-term relationships and generosity should not be valued for their transactional benefits, **but they will always result in strong team culture.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5eet6v688qvarhvam4bffz))
- **Being focused on product development can run the risk of being** **isolated from how the end user will use their application.**
  Testing devices while acting as the end-consumer gives everyone involved in development an idea of **what and why they are building their technology.**
  In all hardware projects I have been a part of having to **assemble, solder and setup devices in-house** has been valuable when working on **longer-term manufacturing plans and has inspired design changes.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh5ef44zry4qdwk42y1dfzr1))

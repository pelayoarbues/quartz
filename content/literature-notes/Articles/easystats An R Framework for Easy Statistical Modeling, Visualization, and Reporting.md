## Highlights
- *easystats* is a collection of R packages, which aims to provide a unifying and consistent framework to tame, discipline, and harness the scary R statistics and their pesky models.
  However, there is not (yet) an *unique* ‚Äúeasystats‚Äù way of doing data analysis. Instead, start with one package and, when you‚Äôll face a new challenge, do check if there is an *easystats* answer for it in other packages. You will slowly uncover how using them together facilitates your life. And, who knows, you might even end up using them all.

- Each *easystats* package has a different scope and purpose. This means your **best way to start** is to explore and pick the one(s) that you feel might be useful to you. However, as they are built with a ‚Äúbigger picture‚Äù in mind, you will realize that using more of them creates a smooth workflow, as these packages are meant to work together. Ideally, these packages work in unison to cover all aspects of statistical analysis and data visualization.

- You‚Äôve probably already heard about the [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/), another very popular collection of packages (*ggplot*, *dplyr*, *tidyr*, ‚Ä¶) that also makes using R easier. So, should you pick the *tidyverse* or *easystats*? **Pick both!**
  Indeed, these two ecosystems have been designed with very different goals in mind. The *tidyverse* packages are primarily made to create a new R experience, where data manipulation and exploration is intuitive and consistent. On the other hand, **easystats** focuses more on the final stretch of the analysis: understanding and interpreting your results and reporting them in a manuscript or a report, while following best practices. You can definitely use the *easystats* functions in a *tidyverse* workflow!

- **Can *easystats* be useful to advanced users and/or developers?**
  Yes, definitely! **easystats** is built in terms of modules that are general enough to be used inside other packages. For instance, the *insight* package is made to easily implement support for post-processing of pretty much all regression model packages under the sun. We use it in all the *easystats* packages, but it is also used in other non-easystats packages, such as [**ggstatsplot**](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/ggstatsplot), [**modelsummary**](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/modelsummary/), [**ggeffects**](https://github.com/strengejacke/ggeffects), and more.

- Dependencies[](https://easystats.github.io/easystats/#dependencies)
  *easystats* packages are designed to be lightweight, *i.e.*, they don‚Äôt have any third-party hard dependencies, other than base-R packages or other *easystats* packages! If you develop R packages, this means that you can safely use *easystats* packages as dependencies in your own packages, without the risk of entering the [dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell).

  As we can see, the only exception is the [`{see}`](https://easystats.github.io/see/) package, which is responsible for plotting and creating figures and relies on [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org), which does have a substantial number of dependencies.

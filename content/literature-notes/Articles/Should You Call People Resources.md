## Highlights
- One of these words is *Resources*, I’ve seen how people recoil when they hear of themselves being referred to as *a resource* and how it can dehumanise individuals within organisations. It’s also not particularly plain English. As a catch-all term, it can mean anything from money, to team members, to desks, chairs, computers and paperclips.

- It’s a word I have stopped saying and very often find myself asking “do you mean people?” when others use it. I genuinely don’t know if they mean people or something else. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jd6vncqhyd6f29z6dz1y5v0j))
- A few weeks ago I doodled this flowchart and it clearly resonated with people, it was very popular (so quickly that I didn’t have the chance to correct the typo)

- Here is my plea, think about the words you use and how they affect others. It doesn’t matter if they don’t offend you, if they offend someone else then it might be time to think about using different ones. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jd6vqh6ffavfpt699qgapsbf))

## Highlights
- “Ideas that are hoarded help no one. Success follows generosity.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb059qheyw95kvkpv36df2nh))
- “In many cases, you’ll find the only thing preventing you from learning is your ego.
  No one enjoys feeling foolish, but attempting something new requires that you climb down from your perch and struggle as a beginner. You must ask questions that reveal your ignorance or attempt skills that make you look uncoordinated.
  Learning demands the willingness to live in a brief state of discomfort. You must believe that looking like a fool for an hour will not ruin your reputation for life.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb05ab4t3q83gd534z99rra2))
- “Self-talk strategies:
  If you need confidence, talk to yourself the way you would talk to a friend.
  If you need persistence, talk to yourself the way you would talk to a student.
  If you need patience, talk to yourself the way you would talk to a child.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb05apdzd5yw9xsdbeh79w7j))

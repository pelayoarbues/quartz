- Full Title: 🔥 Breakthrough: Matrix Multiplication Free LLMs

## Highlights
- The paper "Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling" went completely viral on Twitter, generating 2.3 million impressions due to its innovative approach that eliminates matrix multiplication (MatMul) from LLMs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j056950bvk1gcmf0dwzfe2r4))
- LLMs typically require MatMul for their operations, which significantly limits their deployment to environments equipped with high-end hardware due to the high computational and memory demands. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0569cgxth2wdnr64ww5tat2))
- The research introduces a method that replaces MatMul with simpler computational techniques, dramatically reducing resource consumption while maintaining model performance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0569ffg4wkdbmpxmzs0ek4p))
- **In Dense Layers:** The method substitutes MatMul with ternary accumulations where the weights are only -1, 0, or +1. This reduces the complexity of calculations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0569nkwbtksara9fvm4dhz9))
- **For Self-Attention Mechanisms:** It utilizes a MatMul-free Linear Gated Recurrent Unit (MLGRU) that operates solely on element-wise products. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0569s31nyhhssemhbyy6d7a))
- **In Channel Mixing:** It employs modified Gated Linear Units (GLUs) that integrate BitLinear layers with ternary weights, efficiently managing data integration across channels with reduced computational overhead. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0569xtxk9nvgze92tex7ncg))
- Removing MatMul from the calculations in large language models means these models don't need powerful computers to run. This change allows them to work on simpler devices, like smaller servers or even some personal computers, making advanced AI tools available to more people and places.

- • **Memory Reduction:** Memory usage during inference sees a reduction by more than 10 times compared to unoptimized models.
  • **Efficiency Gains:** Training speed increases by 25.6%, and overall memory requirements drop by 61% relative to conventional approaches.
  • **Hardware Optimization:** Custom FPGA accelerators demonstrate the practicality of this method by processing billion-parameter models with just 13 watts of power. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j056b68x1y9pkejjd15x91f8))
- Diffusion models for image generation often struggle with maintaining image diversity and quality, especially in lower-probability regions of the data distribution. Existing methods like classifier-free guidance (CFG) increase prompt alignment and image quality but reduce variation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j056dekktr9w2wdtq5w4dqpr))
- **Solution** 
  The paper introduces autoguidance, a method where a diffusion model is guided by a less trained or smaller version of itself. This approach aims to improve control over image quality without compromising image diversity, unlike traditional CFG. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j056dmn298ahwcm4bxbtz91g))
- **Results** 
  Autoguidance achieved state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-512 with a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 1.25. It also set new benchmarks in ImageNet-64 with an FID of 1.01, significantly enhancing image quality while preserving diversity.

- **Problem** 
  Transformers, while effective in computer vision, suffer from high computational costs due to quadratic complexity, especially with high-resolution images. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j056e0c37zvzzq3bf1e135cd))
- **Solution** 
  Vision-LSTM (ViL) adapts the xLSTM architecture for vision tasks, using a sequence of alternating bi-directional mLSTM blocks to process image patch tokens efficiently with linear computational complexity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j056e40088anca72fpxjy8pw))
- **Results** 
  ViL outperforms standard vision transformers on ImageNet-1K classification. ViL-T achieves 77.3% accuracy, outdoing DeiT-T at 72.2%. Even in heavily optimized transformer setups, ViL demonstrates competitive performance, with ViL-B reaching 81.6% accuracy versus DeiT-B's 81.8%.

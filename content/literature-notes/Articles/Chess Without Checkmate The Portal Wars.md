  As 2024 draws to a close, it’s worth revisiting the Portal Wars in the U.S. – and how little has changed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je1pj3a4m6fryjt8bcm35rx7))
- • The potential disruptor is CoStar, which has invested over $1 billion in Homes.com to challenge the incumbent portals for dominance, with traffic growing alongside a [massive advertising spend](https://www.mikedp.com/articles/2024/9/10/portal-war-24-what-1-billion-in-advertising-buys-you).

- Corresponding revenue growth has slowed and pales in comparison to the established portals.
  • In the latest quarter, Zillow’s real estate lead gen revenue was about 20 times higher than Homes.com’s.

- **Zillow’s lead** over the #2 portal realtor.com, as measured by real estate lead gen revenue, has remained relatively constant over time – and if anything, has increased.
  • The recent uptick could be a result of strength in a down market, Zillow flexing its Flex muscle, or just slower growth at realtor.com. 
  • But the result is key: the #1 portal’s competitive position tends to get *stronger* over time.

- **The same scenario** has played out in Australia and the U.K., where the leading portals command a significant revenue lead over their rivals.
  • Interestingly, that lead is similar in all three markets – an average of 3.3x and increasing over time. 
  • The #1 portals stay strong and get stronger over time, the [beneficiary of network effects](https://www.mikedp.com/articles/2020/3/4/millions-more-buyers), with no examples of that dominant position being eroded.

- **The bottom line**: Real estate portal competition is like chess without checkmate; there’s no winning move, and it’s not a game that can be won.
  • There’s a flurry of activity, tactical moves, and strategic plans, but very little actually changes; traffic may increase in a [non-zero sum manner](https://www.mikedp.com/articles/2024/5/16/portal-war-24-traffic-is-a-non-zero-sum-game), but revenue – the ultimate metric of delivering value to paying customers – remains competitively static. 
  • Portal competition is exciting, but it’s unlikely to materially change the landscape – which is a perfect example of the [DelPrete Probability Paradox](https://www.mikedp.com/articles/2024/4/8/the-delprete-probability-paradox) in action.

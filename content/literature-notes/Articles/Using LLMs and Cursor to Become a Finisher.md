## Highlights
- Zohaib Rauf describes a pattern I've seen quite a few examples of now: engineers who moved into management but now find themselves able to ship working code again (at least for their side projects) thanks to the productivity boost they get from leaning on LLMs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh6av2ch5axvds7c0105mfjg))
- Zohaib also provides a very useful detailed example of how they use a combination of ChatGPT and Cursor to work on projects, by starting with a spec created through collaboration with o1, then saving that as a `SPEC.md` Markdown file and adding that to Cursor's context in order to work on the actual implementation.

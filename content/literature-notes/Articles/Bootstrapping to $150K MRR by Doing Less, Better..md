## Highlights
- In the summer of 2020, we launched Tally‚Äîthe simplest way to create forms for free. Why? Because every business needs forms, yet form-building is boring and expensive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdekv4rkwsg141kn6mpq0539))
- We faced this problem ourselves. Google Forms is free and powerful, but its design feels off. Typeform is excellent, but becomes costly as you collect more submissions. We believe you shouldn't pay more just because your forms convert. So we introduced something new‚Äîa concept no one had tried before:
  ‚Ä¢ We abandoned volume-based pricing, offering unlimited forms and responses for free
  ‚Ä¢ We created a modern form-building experience‚Äîno drag-and-drop, just a beautifully simple interface that works like a text document ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdekvgn6gewv53mt844phfpv))
- We‚Äôre not chasing shiny new strategies; we‚Äôre focusing on what works for us: building a tool people genuinely love to use. It may sound simple‚Äîeven boring‚Äîbut simplicity, a generous free pan, and a personal touch are the core values that make Tally successful. When others move right, we move left. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdekw861bngxmk5n69zndm57))
- Our vision is clear: we‚Äôre creating the simplest, most intuitive way to build forms. **Instead of a ‚ÄúSwiss Army knife‚Äù full of features, Tally is a finely-tuned piece of software, focused on one thing and doing it exceptionally well.** It‚Äôs pixel-perfect, polished, and built with the user‚Äôs experience at the center.

- This milestone is the result of consistent focus on what matters:
  ‚Ä¢ Sticking to our principles and staying patient 
  ‚Ä¢ Relying on gut feeling and building a product that feels right to use 
  ‚Ä¢ Growing organically by building a product people love to use ([how we grow](https://x.com/mariemartens/status/1517801878062514177?s=21&t=Pfrn7a0w9tet9hGWwr-iuw&ref=blog.tally.so)) 
  ‚Ä¢ Saying no to distractions and prioritizing improvements over new features ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdekx1c7tm11bxzy28eme3x7))
- **Our philosophy remains simple: less is more.** We‚Äôre not here to flood the market with features; we‚Äôre here to make something people love, refining and perfecting as we go. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdekx5bpa9afpfbb88mnk3np))
- Tally has experienced impressive organic growth so far, driven primarily by our product-led strategy. Essentially, our product itself serves as the core engine for growth. We shared more details about this approach [in a previous post](https://blog.tally.so/year-1-how-we-bootstrapped-tally-to-11k-users-and-5k-mrr/). This year, however, we decided to branch out and experiment with paid marketing, particularly influencer partnerships. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdekxh8nqzq1rzm7p99hdyng))
- We‚Äôve noticed that creators have already been sharing content about Tally, so we wanted to test the impact of amplifying this content, starting with YouTube. While it‚Äôs still early in the process (10 live video‚Äôs), we‚Äôre encouraged by the results so far‚Äîlet‚Äôs see where this take us! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdekxr1jg9jmxc3r33cwq2km))
- We‚Äôve always been committed to offering exceptional value for free, and our pricing strategy reflects that mission. As a small, independent, bootstrapped company, we rely solely on subscription fees from our users. This allows us to offer as much value for free as we like, without venture capital influence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdeky4a670vswjn9qe9r4vew))
- So since we launched, we offer unlimited forms, submissions, and 99% of our features entirely for free. This ensures everyone can create and customize smart, beautiful forms and surveys, regardless of budget. Not finding an affordable form-builder was actually [one of the reasons why we founded Tally](https://tally.so/about?ref=blog.tally.so). In the spirit of keeping things simple, we provided one paid subscription tier, [Tally Pro](https://tally.so/help/tally-pro?ref=blog.tally.so) at the lowest price on the market. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdekyqbe4b436kqept96mah5))
- We played around with discounts, with the main goal to attract new users. However, after a while we noticed that this audience led to increased support requests and refunds after the discount ended, which made it economically unfeasible given our generous free tier. That‚Äôs why we decided to step away from traditional discounts and promotional actions. Instead, we focus on building free features and competitively priced premium options. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdekyybq3yyd1p1q6kt6ray0))
- Our goal is to remain the most affordable form builder out there, and we have no plans to raise the price of Tally Pro. However, as our user base grows and enterprise demand increases, we‚Äôve launched [Tally Business](https://tally.so/help/tally-business?ref=blog.tally.so), which includes new features specifically designed to meet the needs of larger organizations. More on this later! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdekzbsmj2pzf5ny1jh8dzna))
- But then reality set in: running Tally demands all our energy, deep focus, and consumes every hour of the day. The dream of flexibility and travel didn‚Äôt last very long. Adding a year of pandemic lockdowns, two kids, and four years of working from home to the mix, work-life balance became almost impossible as the lines between work and personal life blurred completely. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdekzwn6v0f7jj1tnrkk1em6))
- Since our local team was just Filip and me, and we didn‚Äôt have the budget for an office at first, working from home was the default. But, in our home-based bubble, it became harder to stay productive, disconnect from work, and avoid burnout. Over time, it became clear we needed a change. Besides balancing work and life, bridging communication with our amazing remote freelancers, and building a team culture were all growing challenges. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdem01ef4n4yymaam7x0pegn))
- This brings us to our plan for growing the team. While we‚Äôll always keep Tally lean and agile, the product has outgrown what we can handle as founders alone. Supporting a platform now used by over 400,000 users meant it was time to bring in experienced talent. We‚Äôve been lucky to work with a talented pool of contractors (hi Jonathan, Jose, Jared, Anete, Mary & Carlos üëã), but with our dream office in place, we felt ready to hire an in-house team and build together in person. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdem0nszbjqfhaej253kqkph))
- That‚Äôs when Wouter, Full-Stack Engineer, and Frederik, Customer Support Manager, joined us. With Team Tally now four full-time members strong, we‚Äôre more ready than ever to take our next big steps forward. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdem0wafgbj93g13h0wnkthv))
- This year, we had the pleasure of meeting many of you in person as we shared our journey in incredible places around the world. Since day one, we‚Äôve been open about our progress ([here‚Äôs the post we wrote when we reached $5K MRR after our first year](https://blog.tally.so/year-1-how-we-bootstrapped-tally-to-11k-users-and-5k-mrr/)). And even as Tally grows and competitors emerge, we believe it‚Äôs more important than ever to keep sharing our story, insights, and strategies with you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdem13htbc2pk0kphdqavj35))
- In the end, ideas are easy to come by‚Äîthe real power lies in execution, in putting in the hours and showing up every day. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôve done so far, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll continue to do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdem1994bhvsd8fdpdq9mh24))

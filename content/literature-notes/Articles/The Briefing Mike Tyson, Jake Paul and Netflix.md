## Highlights
- This boxing match—the star attraction of a series of matches Netflix is streaming tonight—will likely give the analytically minded company a lot of data to figure out what its future moves might be in live sports. It is increasingly focused on building its advertising business, and sports could be key to that strategy ([prepare yourselves for a bunch of ads tonight](https://url3396.theinformation.com/ls/click?upn=u001.71kYkaWDpGOJSzbGrs4y1X-2B1faynvT004OHUMbiVa4cz18I9qWkMx-2BveAmLvOA5sMloCdDSysZEIQ8uKUI1BHAKd8aSHDe-2FIKAmHhAYqmrYHPYdlYMa8kIIF7rQeo-2B-2BLtEgIfsZXVxi3wyNyVbzTeO5qtUSSYY4cAaKvdAi52-2BIN-2Fb6Y-2FU9r0TzFPWdH6xsMX0-2FdkIc4yqSmvSLuWi4pzrK-2B0FVJGfqZDdf-2Ftn8tRqDLv4soHCLkbEEanprkcJC-2F6zmP_mtX4LGzicLtQy6PxpsvT9GVQls-2BZtcL66REm6RhBLnpwOiSJrGE8-2F01Q-2FR7jNxT3FO8oVvuVBp4GdWd5J1eviKlOotfBODwahStpwR2puKIpDpCpY4RQ5yc0sy4U1gV2QDaSNb3DOccSzUPESrxTU4g3LaIZcfNFnXSvOX10kqyq2uhgZtGioAPgN-2Bm9P76lmNBRnlzDRuOq-2FnipqfnUxiBWqOziUdURyBEAHGUV8ienirnFkeE3i67Fx2cdP-2B-2BTEKUzWXO4wavFuk2ABxnwnLNrjlicoiADFvhESDxtZ-2BLSIQodRk5onGBoRnBgMecShPBTCYl74gQVn-2FnDwROUUxqyKAsHwDY1WPwOFG509ZLLiD7MANORXM4MRmU-2FIqeKus43IaleJd2y3iPVJkBL2Q-3D-3D) from DraftKings, Meta Quest and other sponsors of the match).

- The question is: What kinds of broad sports rights deals can Netflix get in the near term? The big U.S.-centric leagues, including the NFL and NBA, have already signed multiyear broadcast deals with other companies that include streaming rights. One possible partner for Netflix is the UFC, which [plans to begin shopping around](https://url3396.theinformation.com/ls/click?upn=u001.71kYkaWDpGOJSzbGrs4y1R6q2XTiDSqeOT8QZgOWsh0Psz4C3vBIU3OHSbTO6kyKegAFBtVNkjut5WLMcnZx3pmKaba-2FwmJEhC3lEd-2B3CaOldlj-2ByQKQDMHdCenkEbQzLde6yyzD3a4GlGUnezrh4Vy82kHdzaA77xXoWU7L8roLI5hZFxWDcijkWv-2FmeSQEa2O8TbzXkQ744Nu-2BDah0q82QsZCiqzRxbBlFbN6itTVRCaS6v7mjw0BHVPHrLZK8K0vihh5eRZRgDwven72A3g-3D-3D68GH_mtX4LGzicLtQy6PxpsvT9GVQls-2BZtcL66REm6RhBLnpwOiSJrGE8-2F01Q-2FR7jNxT3FO8oVvuVBp4GdWd5J1eviKlOotfBODwahStpwR2puKIpDpCpY4RQ5yc0sy4U1gV2QDaSNb3DOccSzUPESrxTU4g3LaIZcfNFnXSvOX10kqyq2uhgZtGioAPgN-2Bm9P76lmNBRnlzDRuOq-2FnipqfnUxiBWqOziUdURyBEAHGUV8ienirnFkeE3i67Fx2cdP-2B-2BTTW9h7Xf2Pc8QantDI67DKbP1aebIqNcPlIVA6Z2RF6QIdhh5jgwz6awsmUGGH72P8SMWta-2BIOB0vkklJekMA5lD-2FtWa-2B5jhQcEA2pg-2FbH3pUtzMvO1PaWo5-2BtIHWkmD8Cuk-2Fwnee0mdFrr3IeWLiVg-3D-3D) for a 10-year deal with someone to air its mixed martial arts contests. Netflix already has a streaming agreement with World Wrestling Entertainment, which is owned by the same company, TKO Group Holdings, that owns the UFC. If the Tyson-Paul fight lands with audiences tonight, don’t be surprised to see the streamer get in the octagon with the UFC.

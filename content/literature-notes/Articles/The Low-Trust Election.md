## Highlights
- I think the major dynamic of 2024 was an issue of trust — trust in institutions, trust in information, trust in others. We’ve just lived through the Low-Trust Election and the change in dynamics it represents is going to make our heads spin for decades.

- The day-to-day experience of living in America is no longer just one of being bombarded with advertising, it’s morphed into wall to wall scams — the mobile ads claiming you can win cash playing solitaire, the sports ads filled with gambling to try to get you addicted, the health ads filled with supplements that don’t do anything. We all know they’re scams, but they’re so omnipresent that it’s easy to make yourself wonder if they aren’t. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jc48ex0y76fgjb083g7yh8cr))
- The media monoculture is dead, and it’s been replaced by a million talking heads that appear on your phone and tell you not to trust things. Not to trust your doctors, not to trust your teachers, not to trust the government. They appear on your phone no matter what you do because an algorithm has decided they’re the most likely thing to keep you watching so you can keep getting the ads.

- The Republican Party has been the party of the Low-Trust voter for a very long time. It’s the party that wants to get rid of institutions, of any of the bonds that connect us all together. The Democratic Party is the party of institutions, the party of Good Governance. It’s the party of trusting other Americans to make good choices for you. There is very little that the Democrats can do to appeal to the Low-Trust voter, and you saw what that means for the future of our politics last night. I would go so far as to say that we’re seeing the effects of a realignment of what partisanship is. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jc48h67dsw58x384k08rnd8b))
- The GOP is the party of the perpetual outsider and the Low-Trust voter, the people calling for things to be torn down. The Democrats are the insiders, the institutionalists. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jc48gvx6nbaaxeycscg94mf8))
- The terrifying thought I keep returning to is that if the government’s decisions keep making people’s lives worse, as we know that Trump’s policies are going to do, won’t that just keep creating more Low-Trust voters? If we want to try to rebuild after what’s coming, we’re going to have to figure out a way to break that cycle. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jc48kkf68zxr0vz16geefcys))
